(2021) https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.712819/full,"Yes, and the vision is explicit","After the abrupt shock and the huge impacts of the Prestige oil spill in 2002, artisanal fishers from Lira (north-central coast of Galicia) initiated a process or preparation phase to create a ‘Marine Reserve of Fishing Interest’ (hereinafter referred to as MPA to simplify) that concluded with its formalization in April 2007, with the name of ‘Os Miñarzos’ . The objective of the marine reserve is to recover fish stocks and ensure sustainable revenues for fishers by using a co-management system.","More than 10 years after its full implementation, the transformative change that took place since the creation of the MPA not only had repercussions on fishing practices and outcomes (e.g. higher abundance of species and economic revenues), but also on the beliefs and social values of the main fishers, scientists and representatives of the regional administration involved in the Management Body of the MPA. Trust and cooperation, essential elements to successfully govern common pool resources, have been improved since fishers provide data and participate in different monitoring programs. There has also been a notable reduction of conflicts and mistrust between the administration and the fisheries sector, favoring that most decisions concerning fishing activities within the MPA are taken by consensus. Another sign of progress was the collective behavior of local fishers working within the MPA who, after the decision of the regional administration to discontinue financially supporting the surveillance to the area in 2010, continued with the inertia of social norms to comply with the fisheries law, even 2 years after that decision. Starting with a fragmented and divided fisheries sector, the main challenge was to construct a common vision of a sustainable future for the MPA and the economic development of the associated coastal communities. The MPA has inspired other neighboring communities to propose another MPA of fishing interest on the Northern coast of Galicia (Decree 28/2009, of January 29, creating the Marine Reserve of Fishing Interest Ría de Cedeira), while a procedure for the extension of the MPA of Os Miñarzos has also been initiated and it is currently in the final stage. The objective is to move from the current protected area of 2,074 to 50,000 ha (in coastal waters), where eight fishing communities and 750 small-scale fishing vessels will potentially benefit. The case of Os Miñarzos also inspired other coastal communities not only in other regions of Spain (namely Catalonia and Andalucia), but also the new fisheries Law in Portugal as well as the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication developed by FAO. All of these initiatives inspired by the Os Miñarzos case have been highly positive to develop new sustainable trajectories, and they are currently in different phases of development and degree of success. More recently, the transformative initiative initiated in Os Miñarzos served as the seed to create a new network of small-scale fishers in Latin America and the Caribbean, Portugal and Spain, involving more than 20 million of fishers(women).",Southern Europe,Spain,"A Coruña, Galicia",Opponent/resistant,Promoter,,,,,,,Promoter,,,,Opponent/resistant,,,,Promoter,Promoter,,,,Both public and private sectors,,2007,Yes,Still ongoing,One decade,No,"Fisheries, Tourism",,"Marine areas (mangroves, coral reefs etc.)",Community,"Between 100 to 1,000",Up to 10,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,I don't know,Large positive effect,Slight positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,,I don't know,,Slight positive effect,Large  positive effect,Large  positive effect,Large  positive effect,No change,Large  positive effect,Large  positive effect,Large  positive effect,Large  positive effect,I don´t know,,Large positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,Slight positive effect,Slight positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,Slight positive effect,I don't know,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,I don't know,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,I don't know,,,,,,,,"Promoting inclusive governance approaches through stakeholder engagement and the inclusion of indigenous peoples and local communities to ensure equity and participation, Producing and consuming food sustainably, Promoting sustainable governance and management of seascapes, oceans and marine systems",,,,"Decision making in the context of resilience and uncertainty, Laws/regulations and implementation of public policies",,,"Values, Changes in primary sector, Local community coordination",,"Unsustainable production and consumption patterns, overexploitation of fishery resources and the Prestige oil spill",,,N/A - This is an example of a transformative change,"Yes, I want such an example to motivate others","Building cooperative arrangements between fishers helped to have higher level of trust, cohesion, transparency and better status of fishery resources and revenues","The author notes that  Galician SSF were able to maintain key basic elements for resilience building over space and time such as the maintenance of a high diversity of harvested species, an institutionalized connectivity between stakeholders and fishing communities, and the support of active participation through the decision making processes.

In collaboration with the regional government, fishers decided to follow the MSC certification protocol to differentiate the product in relation to other species (coming to the Spanish and international markets namely from Marocco).  They also decided to adopt a management plan that included a series of measures to control fishing effort, such as establishing a closed season from December to July, setting the minimum catch weight per fish at 1 kg and the total catch quota at 10 tonnes per year per vessel or per season, and also limiting the number of pots per vessel to 350. Fishers  were also aware that they were not getting value for money from their sustainable credentials, not least because prices and catches were not as stable as they would have liked.

On the economic front, the changes after the octopus certification have also been positive. The price paid for Marine Stewardship Council-certified octopus outperforms its non-certified rivals from other ports in the area by between 15.2% and 24.6%. Certification has also enabled fishers to access new markets in the USA, Switzerland, Denmark and Spain, and has helped them to reorganise the auction system, giving them more control over sales and stabilising prices. The cofradias (auction markets) are still interested in maintaining sales of part of their catches to local markets.",

Outcomes from the two dialogues suggest that keystone actors have an interest in operating as global norm entrepreneurs, setting new agendas, standards, and ways of operating, which can potentially cascade through the seafood production system and also influence other actors shaping the ocean. Keystone actors can bridge knowledge systems and contribute to connecting companies, regions, and technologies based on a vision of ocean stewardship for the benefit of mankind. Similar examples of norm entrepreneurs are, for example, found in relation to environmental reporting schemes in national electricity sectors, environmental standards for the financial sector, and voluntary sustainability reporting for companies in general. There are no guarantees that this will happen, however. Previous experiences with voluntary environmental commitments show mixed results and illustrate the importance of audits, disclosure, and sanctioning mechanisms to ensure changes in behavior (Source: Osterblom et al. 2017; https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1704453114)","The collaboration was initiated (2016) and first coordinated (2016-2019) by the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) at Stockholm University  with the Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics at the Royal Swedish Academy of Science, the University of Lancaster, and the Stanford Center.  The SeaBOS model is based on a unique legal construct that is different from other industry-only associations or science-industry organizations. Developing and implementing a governance model that ensures independent science on the one hand, and science-based company action on the other, has been a core priority.The small group of 10 companies committed to the SeaBOS initiative is able to influence the strategic direction of more than 639 subsidiaries with operations in at least 93 different countries. This connectivity is creating new incentives for integrating sustainability concerns, because companies are operating on all continents, making them aware of the sustainability standards and requirement of all major markets. However, the sector is still relatively fragmented in different segments: for example, as illustrated by companies primarily catching tuna, whitefish, or small pelagic species, or engaging in aquaculture or in feeds. There also seem to be three major regional clusters of corporations based primarily in Asia, Europe, and North America, corresponding to the three dominant markets for seafood.",

scale what achievable quality goals are in the field of water quality, biodiversity, ammonia
and nitrate emissions, circularity, and agricultural nature management and search for
economic mechanisms to make this possible. A system of stacked rewards, including
payments for ecosystem services, is part of this. Both models are examples of collaborative
governance and steering based on shared values and goals (e.g., by using key performance
indicators) instead of more traditional top-down steering focused on measures. A value-based steering model increases the possibilities for multiple value creation and emphasizes
interdependence, mutual trust and shared responsibilities.",,

We will propose to reveal if there are aspects common to both problems, if they can make contributions that are useful to each one and that are synergistic with each other and if from the discipline of Law Environmental, additional tools can be provided to the existing ones.","Several studies on the Luján river basin have highlighted the relevance of the
pollution, particularly since the 1990s, due to the increase in the urbanization and industrial activity. It has been identified as the most serious problem of the basin the high contamination of both surface and surface water resources underground, from the area with the highest population and industrial density, from Mercedes to the mouth of the Luján river in the Paraná delta. perez Carrera, Parra and Cirelli (2012) analyzed the content of trace metals in samples of soil and plant surface water in the upper basin and detected levels of
contamination with metals, which in some cases were greater than the legal limits allowed. Based on these measurements, this study concludes that efforts to recover the quality of the Luján river should focus on the adequate treatment of the effluents and in compliance with current regulations regarding maximum levels discharge admitted in current regulations (Pérez Carrera, Parra and Cirelli, 2012).
From a water policy approach at the provincial level, Gutiérrez (2011) has demonstrated the low level of compliance with the principles of the IWRM paradigm: integrality, participation and decentralization. Only the first of them is forcefully incorporated into the legislation of the Province of Buenos Aires. Nevertheless, there is meager financial sustainability and limited tools for participation in order to implement those objectives.
This situation is contradictory to the ""Guiding Principles of Water Policy of the Argentine Republic"", which introduce concepts of IWRM, among them, the basins as planning units or decentralized environmental policy and participatory. These deficiencies in the implementation of the IWRM model are are linked to the limitations of the competence of the National State in water matter. However, the level of compliance with the principles of the ecosystem approach, nor its complementation with the IWRM paradigm, despite the fact that the various investigations ecological and hydroecological have pointed out the need to complement both approaches, both at the regional level of the Río de la Plata basin and at the local level.

The FAL regulated mobility of the fleets through zoning, allocated exclusive territorial users rights for fisheries (TURFs), and introduced a differential individual transferable quota for fully exploited species. This legislation enabled a national-scale transformation in governance toward a more sustainable pathway, particularly for the socially and economically important artisanal sector.","The ""Loco"" fishery, historically the most economically important shellfish in Chile, and its collapse in the late 1980s served as a major trigger for governance transformation. Before its collapse, the Loco fishery operated under an open access regime, fishers had no incentives to cooperate, and short-term individualism prevailed. The Management and Exploitation Areas for Benthic Resources (MEABR) policy in Chile is the most innovative and transformative management instrument of the The 1991 Fishery and Aquaculture Law (FAL). The governance transformation represented by the MEABR policy improved the trajectory and dynamics of Chile's benthic coastal social-ecological system. The fishery success of the MEABR policy includes a significant increase in abundance and individual size of targeted resources within MEABR areas, in comparison with open-access sites that continue to be heavily harvested by fishers. Furthermore, MEABR areas also afford substantial benefits for biodiversity conservation, because they are effective no-take areas for all species other than the handful (generally two to five) chosen each year for harvesting. Moreover, the perceptions and environmental awareness of fishers who have engaged with the MEABR policy has changed markedly, with evidence of fishers themselves becoming environmental stewards. The new governance system created the conditions for the fisher communities to replace the role of an external authority, creating their own institutions. They established local rules for the extraction of the common pool resources and developed a surveillance system to curtail poaching within MEABR areas, although poaching is still one of the major management problems that must be addressed.

Many benefits are attributed to TURFs, including a significant increase in the abundances of the main fisheries resources compared to sites with free access, as substantial instruments for conservation as well as an effective resource management option. Nevertheless, the performance of TURFs has been shown to be heterogeneous, observing good, as well as bad, cases, but there is a general consensus that this system has its advantages. Despite the beneficial results in some aspects, the implementation showed different dynamics. Some TURFs have managed to recover their populations, achieving success in the co-management of species, but others have shown economic problems.","Natural productivity given by upwelling within the Humboldt Current System makes Chile one of the most important fishery nations of the world. But this has not prevented that the history of overexploitation observed for world fisheries has been also locally repeated.  The Fisheries and Aquaculture Law (FAL) drastically reformed the right to fish within and between the industrial and artisanal fishing sectors. The FAL regulated mobility of the fleets through zoning, allocated exclusive territorial users rights for fisheries (TURFs), and introduced a differential individual transferable quota for fully exploited species. The FAL provided formal recognition of artisanal fishers and incorporated two new regulations that established user rights. First, artisanal fishers were assigned exclusive fishery access rights (to all species) within a zone that extends 5 nautical miles  from the shoreline along ca. 2,500 km of coast  and around Chilean oceanic islands. This regulation aimed to reduce conflict, especially between midscale artisanals and the industrial fleet. Second, the FAL assigned TURFs over inshore areas of seabed to registered artisanal fisher associations (unions, cooperatives) for the management of benthic resources. This regulation targets small-scale artisanals  as a response to overexploitation of benthic fisheries. ",

The conservation futures project worked with protected area managers in Colombia, to create capacities to anticipate future ecological change, the implications of such changes in social and ecological values, and implications for governance. We document its application in a pilot programme in Colombia. ","We documented how the future-oriented approach helped protected area managers to understand climate adaptation as a governance issue, not just as a technical problem.

Six + years past and looking back now, we realise that defining more explicit practical goals from the very beginning (e.g., area size under organic cultivation, ecosystems and species to be restored and conserved, local industries to be revived, etc.) could've been helpful (maybe). This is why in 2021-2022 we conducted a series of the Xinshe SEPLS Futures workshops to figure out these practical goals from a community perspective - to natigate or adaptive co-management processes towards 2026. But, on the other hand, not having it done earlier (between 2016-2020) might've also been beneficial and more natural, as we did not feel restrained in our efforts and were working on the most urgent issues at the time (""picking the low-hanging fruit"").

Here we provide our brief summary points on the lessons learned:
- Setting of ecological, jurisdictional and/ or socio-cultural boundaries of an ILSA should be locally sensitive and achieved by the means of iterative and collaborative processes, while boundary checking with the engagement of multiple stakeholders is equally important for timely management adjustments;
- Multi-stakeholder partnership, cross-sectoral and cross-boundary co-operation are best attained through the “observe and involve” principle, where the stakeholder interest and willingness to engage is closely monitored and stimulated by the means of various facilitation tools and engagement strategies;
- Five socio-ecological perspectives of the Satoyama Initiative and 20 indicators of resilience in SEPLS are highly recommended to other ILSA practitioners who are looking for a suitable “starter pack” for environmental and socio-economic issue identification and monitoring and evaluation purposes. These tools may be further adapted in accordance with the place-based characteristics and ACM needs of a concrete ILSA;
- Monitoring and evaluation for adaptive co-management needs to be regular, consistent, locally sensitive, and participatory in nature, while the combination of TEK (ILK) and expert knowledge, qualitative and quantitative methodologies from social and natural sciences is most desirable. Communication of monitoring and evaluation results to all relevant stakeholders is key to the transparency and credibility of an ILSA; and
- Extending an ILSA “from -scape to scale” implies both sharing of its own experiences and learning from other case studies locally, regionally, nation-wide, and globally. The combination of relational, knowledge and political resources is likely to create an enabling environment for the success of upscaling processes.",Thank you so much for such a well-structured and comprehensive questionnaire.

The use of guanaco fibre could become an important complement to regional economies, transforming this activity into an engine for local
socio-economic development, playing an important role in the conservation of the
species.
Guanaco conservation and sustainable use in Patagonia illustrates the importance of
approaching interlinked human and natural systems in a holistic way. The foreign
productive model imposed in Patagonia resulted in severe desertification and conservation threats to wildlife and its habitat. A native species became a pest to the new settlers and this image persists today. This narrative is promoted by livestock productive agencies and social media, and accepted by some environmental authorities due to an unbalanced political strength and lobby capacity between sectors: Argentina has always based a large part of its economy on livestock and agricultural commodities.","The guanaco sustainable use is a way to recouple social-ecological systems in Patagonia, to restore the cultural heritage of stewardship traditions, and to achieve habitat and species conservation.

Such schemes should have an adaptive management approach and knowledge co-production. They should include transparent co-participation in the follow-up, monitoring, and evaluation of processes, as well as the horizontal transmission of management results among stakeholders. Until now, an inorganic consultation and participation process continue, prioritizing contact with large landowners that have followed the logic of “invest little and earn a lot” in relation to guanaco use, with little concern for animals’ welfare because they are considered a pest.
Strong participation of the State is still necessary, both in the control of the productive processes and in the development and marketing of products. ","Yes, I want such an example to motivate others","1) Nature conservation is a highly political process; 2) Guanaco conservation requires integrating scientific knowledge from disparate disciplines as well as LIK into decision-making and strengthening participatory processes; 3) The implementation of animal welfare protocols based on science is crucial to achieve guanaco sustainable use; 4) A transparent market for guanaco fibre should be established and added value at the local level
should be promoted; 5) Harvesting guanacos for meat requires filling information gaps; 6) The uncertainty regarding resource rights over guanacos and the unequal distribution of usufruct rights reduces the likelihood of producers becoming interested in joining the activity and instead promotes poaching; 7) Need for governmental support at different levels; 8) Need for work on policies at a regional scale.","The rationale behind guanaco sustainable use experiences is that by allowing the
commercial utilization of fibre obtained from live-shorn individuals, the development of positive local attitudes towards conservation would be encouraged. In turn, this should result in some or all of the following: a decrease in poaching; the replacement of introduced livestock with guanacos; an increase in tolerance for guanacos on private lands; better management of total grazing pressure; reduced land degradation; improving vegetation and biodiversity outcomes; and greater support for conservation measures. 
For this, it is necessary to establish marketing strategies that generate a demand for this product and ensure that this material comes from legal sources, certifying its traceability.

","Yes, I want such an example to motivate others","The notion of the ‘‘right to decide” has been raised as a key concern of communities where projects are seen as imposed. The movements that mobilise against mining activities can be framed as Environmental Justice Movements (EJM).
The spread of anti-mining mobilisations has been related to a cascade effect of previous conflicts in Latinamerica that triggered a learning process about the impacts of mining activities and the power of social mobilisation.
Argentina is a federal country and allows semi-direct democratic instruments (local plebiscites or referenda on environmental issues). The mining decision makers are close to the sites of conflict and it forces them to face more political accountability. The movements drived to plebiscites, and reached national media. As a result, provincial and national laws were sanctioned.
The most significant outcomes: the stopping of projects (cancellations or temporal suspensions) in 20 out of the 38 cases. In 2007, the Law 7722 (""Guardian of Water"") was passed; it regulates metal mining activity by prohibiting the use of toxic chemical substances, in the province of Mendoza. It is considered a true manifestation of social consensus, since it integrated the feeling of people regarding the care of the environment and water.",,"Large scale mining can lead to conflicts: 38 large scale mining conflicts in Argentina (2002-2018). Communities mobilising against large scale mining are reacting to: 1) perceived or visible environmental impacts, 2) lack of information, representation and participation in decision making processes, 3) lack of monetary compensation, 4) distrust of the state (lack of independence and control capacity) and mining companies."

The aim of the articule is to demonstrate that the production-oriented perspective on agricultural production is narrow-view. In many instances, a lack of food production is not the main reason why people are food insecure; barriers to access and distribution—including poverty—often matter more. Both biodiversity conservation and food security are influenced by many variables beyond agricultural production For example, equity, empowerment, and good governance are important for both conservation and food security. An integrated social–ecological systems approach is needed because agricultural landscapes are complex adaptive systems nested across scales which affect both human well-being—including food security—and ecosystems. ",A conceptual model that allow to integrate socioeconomic variables and biophysical variables affecting agricultural production is needed if we seek to act in an holystic manner to adress biodiversity loss without compromising the availability of food in front of the uprising demand.

One choice is extensively reared livestock, where agricultural production is aligned with local ecosystems according to agroecological principles, building on the integration of livestock into mixed farming systems, and as utilizers of pasture biomass. The study contributes to previous research by articulating the links between agroecology and the concept “less but better” and to previous work on assessing the sustainability of meat by combining a holistic assessment encompassing ecological, social, economic, and governance dimensions with additional quantitative and qualitative analysis of climate impact, contribution to global food security, economic performance and effects on working conditions.","Agroecological transitions are an example of TC since they address technical and social changes in one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. In particular, grain production to feed animals for human consumption is one of the main drivers of the expansion of the agricultural frontier, while meat production is one of the main emitters of greenhouse gases. Both contribute directly and indirectly to biodiversity loss. Reducing meat consumption is necessary but not sufficient. It is essential to transform the mode of production towards more sustainable agriculture and livestock farming. This paper presents a solid case of TC as it includes a comprehensive holistic study of the transition’s impact on sustainability in different dimensions: environmental, social, economic and governance.

However, the change achieved may not be enough and trade-offs and synergies between different aspects of sustainability need to be considered. And, importantly, the success of transitions will depend to a large extent on the relationship with buyers, as changes may mean lower yields in the early stages, and producers will need sales to sustain the approach long enough to see the benefits.",,

Even after the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, slave-worked plantations continued to be profitable well into the 1860s in other countries (Blackburn, 2011).

CFCs were used widely as refrigerants, in aerosol sprays, and other consumer products. Ozone depletion has negative impacts for human and ecological health (e.g. marine ecosystems, plants). In response to evidence about the ozone hole, governments universally ratified the Montreal Protocol in 1987; the initial agreement phased out the use of CFCs and halons. Additional amendments in 1990, 1992, and 1997 phased out other chemicals and accelerated the phase-out process. The Montreal Protocol is considered to-date the only successful international environmental agreement.

Rachel Golden Kroner,rachelelizabethgolden@gmail.com,Fellow,Transformative Change,AAAS,,Energy transitions,https://coaltransitions.org/ and many others,"Yes, and the vision is implicit","transition away from fossil fuels, including a just transition","The literature includes a large set of examples on energy transitions. For instance, historically, rising oil prices led to a strong transformation in many countries (Acar and Lindmark, 2017). Preceding the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, oil had transformed the economies and energy systems in the western countries after WWII. Cheap oil flowed into Western Europe after 1948 and it was also a commodity that was included in the Marshall plan. In short, oil was an integrated part of the technologies, industrial and geographical structures that emerged around the internal combustion engine. As such it was an important determinant for several structural changes during the period. Furthermore, oil did not only substitute for other energy carriers, such as coal, but was also added on top of the existing energy systems, allowing an overall increase of the energy use. Not the least, heavier oils were used in thermo-electrical power plants and for domestic heating. This confluence of factors had by the 1970s made several OECD countries dependent on oil as a strategic energy commodity over which considerable market power could be exercised. 
Increasing energy prices means that the conversion efficiency of energy into an economic service flow must be improved, if the service flow is to remain constant. This is why the oil crises of 1973 and 1979 constituted a powerful transformation pressure and incentive for technological change in the western economies. In the aftermath of these crises, it became an important political objective to decouple oil from economic growth. This ‘oil dependency’ made the western world vulnerable to embargos. Acar and Lindmark (2017) shows that the decoupling was indeed successful, which was compatible with period specific occurrences, such as the introduction of an active climate policy with the EU ETS as a system. Moreover, the coal industry underwent substantial structural changes in the 1970s and the 1980s, with the coal miners’ strike in the UK in the early 1980s as an example.
In the extant literature, energy transition implies the transformation of the modes of energy production and consumption, which mainly targets the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by limiting or reducing consumption of fossil fuels (Swartenbroekx, 2018). It entails the deployment of renewable energy, which met around 13% of global final energy demand in 2020 (REN21, 2022). Yet, as the energy transition is land-based (e.g., wind farms can be based onshore or offshore, space is needed in order to install solar panels, or water dams affect landscape around, etc.), there are also large controversies on the impacts of these transitions given current power structures and possible external costs on the environment and society (despite being negligible when compared to the externalities from fossil fuel use). For instance, the transition to biofuels that took place particularly in the tropical countries has triggered fear about an unstoppable process of “destroying rainforests, wrecking ecosystems, leaching the soil, creating fertilizer and pesticide runoff s that will poison the oceans” (Mathews, 2008: 112). Besides, the transition needs to be accelerated and reflected in dedicated and coherent policies and regulations under the urgency of climate change mitigation, which is vital for biodiversity and the protection and restoration of ecosystem services.
Recently, the literature focuses increasingly on just energy transformations toward decarbonisation of regions where there has been a historical dependence on fossil fuel industry parts. These examples suggest that a successfully managed coal mining transition can take up to 25 years to ensure new jobs for the workforce, regional economic restructuring, and new investment in business alternatives (www.coaltransitions.org). They also indicate the need for a sense of security in times of structural, legitimate dialogue processes, proactive social movement discourse, national or regional transition bodies, providing funding for diversifying of current industries, job retraining programmes, regional infrastructure investments, and “soft attractiveness factors” (e.g., beautification, education investments or enhanced internet access (e.g. Newell and Simms, 2020; Herdic, 2019; Crowe and Li, 2020; Olson-Hazboun, 2018; Snyder, 2018).",several Western countries (e.g Europe),n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,Promoter,,,,,"Promoter, Opponent/resistant",,Opponent/resistant,Opponent/resistant,Promoter,,,,I don’t know,,1970s during oil crises,Yes,n/a,Decades,"a successfully managed coal mining transition can take up to 25 years to ensure new jobs for the workforce, regional economic restructuring, and new investment in business alternatives",Energy,,"multiple, if not all (fossil fuel emissions affect climate change, which affects all biomes)",Other,Over a million,I don't know,Slight positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,Slight positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,,I don't know,,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,I don´t know,,I don't know,I don't know,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,Large positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,Slight positive effect,I don't know,Large positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,,,,,,,,Promoting sustainable energy and infrastructure projects and production,,,,Decision making in the context of resilience and uncertainty,,,"Changes in primary sector, Structural transition, Financial flows",,"Concentrations of power associated with current dominant economic systems (capitalism), Financial insecurity, Unsustainable production and consumption patterns",,,,"Yes, I want such an example to motivate others",Crises present opportunities for transformation,,

Illegal logging in tropical rainforest in Indonesian Borneo, combined with poor quality of life for local people is a major issue in this region. By listening carefully (called ‘radical listening’) to the needs of local people, the founder of Health in Harmony learned that much illegal logging was happening because people needed money for health care. She devised a solution that involved providing free or low cost health care to communities that agreed to work together to stop illegal logging. Health care came from volunteer North American doctors, who eventually trained local doctors in Borneo. She started work in Gunung Palung National Park, reconnecting rainforest ‘health’ to human health, and has now expanded to other areas. The outcome is that 52,000 ha of rainforest have been regenerated, and there has been a 90% decline in illegal logging households, plus 120,000 people now able to access health care, a 67% decline in infant mortality, and a 54% decline in births per mother.

From paper linked above: 
The recent 70% decline in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon suggests that it is possible to manage the advance of a vast agricultural frontier. Enforcement of laws, interventions in soy and beef supply chains, restrictions on access to credit, and expansion of protected areas appear to have contributed to this decline, as did a decline in the demand for new deforestation. The supply chain interventions that fed into this deceleration are precariously dependent on corporate risk management, and public policies have relied excessively on punitive measures. Systems for delivering positive incentives for farmers to forgo deforestation have been designed but not fully implemented. Territorial approaches to deforestation have been effective and could consolidate progress in slowing deforestation while providing a framework for addressing other important dimensions of sustainable development.

With an integrated approach to action attending to the interlinks between health, population and environment, the initiative has become a multi-sectoral effort with the support from different segments of the national government (e.g., environment, education), local government, groups of international students, and a private company. Peer-learning strategies (e.g., students serving as messengers between school, family, village and other children, farmer-to-farmer sharing, provision of training by each women leader to multiple households) led to snowballing and cascading effects on extended communities.

There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ nature climate solutions. A nature based solution (NDC) strategy for an industrialized country, such as Australia, will be different to an NDC for that of a small island developing state (SIDS), such as Fiji. NDCs are, by definition, determined by the individual countries with the common goals described in the Paris Agreement as tools of incremental change.There are specific actions for including blue carbon in NDCs and related actions available to all countries. Based on this need, the Blue Carbon initiative offers a tiered approach, represented by engagement levels for the inclusion of coastal wetlands in NDCs, similar to that employed by the IPCC Wetlands Supplement. This tiered approach accounts for the varying starting points, motivations and data and capacity levels among countries, as well as reflecting the broader stepwise nature of designing NDCs. Countries can identify their desired entry point and engagement level for including blue carbon and follow the guidance accordingly.","The Blue Carbon Initiative works to: Develop management approaches, financial incentives and policy mechanisms for ensuring the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of coastal blue carbon ecosystems; Engage local, national, and international governments in order to promote policies that support coastal blue carbon conservation, management and financing; Develop comprehensive methods for assessing blue carbon stocks and emissions; Implement projects around the world that demonstrate the feasibility of blue carbon accounting, management and incentive agreements; and Support scientific research into the role of coastal blue carbon ecosystems for climate change mitigation. The International Blue Carbon Initiative’s team of 34 experts in the fields of coastal carbon measurement, remote sensing, and climate policy produced a manual with the goal standardizing protocols for sampling methods, laboratory measurements, and analysis of blue carbon stocks and fluxes. The manual will provide scientists and coastal managers with a practical tool to produce robust blue carbon data.",

The producers that are promoting this change can be included in two very different groups: the ones that have a clear philosophical, ethical, and political position of disagreement with industrial agriculture and, the others that continue sharing some or many aspects of industrial agriculture but that realized the importance of an ecosystemic vision of agriculture. Even with such big differences both are implementing practices like services crops and reducing the use of pesticides and industrial fertilizers and thus allowing a way for society to rediscover our strong relationship with nature.

This is much more important considering the bottom-up characteristic of this agroecological change. ","After twenty years of the beginning of the herbicide-dependent no-till agriculture, and around 2010, extensive agroecological-based practices began to expand in Argentina.   Different forces converged for this to occur driven by actors on both the production and consumption side of food systems.  Consumers increased demands for healthy and nature-friendly agriculture because of the increasing awareness about food and environmental pollution with biocides, accompanied by growing concerns raised by a few persons of academic, scientific, and technical public institutions vis-à-vis the unsustainability of conventional production practices.   Driven by health concerns regarding biocide use, rural communities increasingly protested their extensive use near towns, rural schools, and small cities. Urban consumers increasing demand for safe foods created markets with small-scale farmers adjacent to cities allowing them to produce fresh foods with agroecological practices. Cooperatives formed, increasing collaboration and reducing the cost of local high-quality produce. Very few isolated large-scale crops and cattle producers that had values of deep respect and love for nature and that also were worried about the use of biocides began to communicate to each other about a nature-friendly agriculture. They created networks for sharing visions, problems, and experiences, including innovation by adapting traditional and modern practices for example, using Vicia sp. as a service crop with precision agriculture. Other farmers, more numerous and related to industrial agriculture through no-till herbicide-dependent practices were affected by increasing herbicide-resistant weeds, losses of productivity, health concerns, and other factors, and, thus, began to explore nature-based practices. Without direct economic subsidies and with additional agricultural taxes, these practices are expanding territorially reducing costs mainly through the use of agroecology-based technologies.
I am personally living this process since a decade ago from several points of view: through my academic activity, through my collaboration in managing and administrating a family farm and ranch, and through my participation in rural citizens networks for the development of agroecology-based production systems.

","Waterfowl hunting in Argentina is a profitable industry that attracts hunters from all over the world. Most hunting occurs as high-end hunting tourism, through which registered outfitters service predominantly foreign clients on private lands. Lead pollution from hunting ammunition is increasingly recognized as a significant local problem, impacting wildlife, aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and extending to vulnerable human rural communities. The change in the ammunition used for hunting has maintained people´s income but reduced the contamination in the ground, water and peoples food sources. Based on government data, at least 56 tons of ammunition lead were added to wetlands in Santa Fe province alone between 2007 and 2009 by hunting.  Accumulation of lead in natural wetlands, ducks consumed and rice fields where waterfowl hunting is practiced were documented before banning the use of this toxic ammunition, and promoting non/less-toxic alternatives.

In the specific context of Argentina, where hunting is minimally for subsistence and largely for sport, lead pollution stands out as a uniquely accessible and remediable environmental problem. This is one issue for which there is a known solution with proven chances of success if constituents understand the risks at stake and are willing to contribute individually to the collective wellbeing by switching to nontoxic options. Moreover, the recommended shift is neither opposed to progress and economic gain, nor does it disagree with the needs and livelihoods of the main constituents, since hunting itself is not contested, but rather urged to adapt to current societal, bioethical, and sustainability standards. Changes in hunting practices in Argentina are long overdue.","Reducing lead contamination is critical for the conservation or many threatened species, just the change to other non-toxic ammunition will save many species from the threat of population extinction. At the same time the health of many people, particularly children,  will be improved, and lives saved. ",

In general, the sea and its resources are governed by policies crafted in offices far from coasts and coastal communities. The best and most effective way to do this is to involve the people that understand the local situation better than anyone else – the fishers. They have the in-depth local knowledge to ensure management strategies are adapted to suit the unique needs of the area and its resources. By enabling small-scale fishers to sustainably manage the resources they depend on, we aim to restore the health of Mediterranean fish stocks and secure people’s livelihoods for the long term.","The situation in the Mediterranean Sea is particularly dramatic: today, 75% of assessed fish stocks are overfished. Without urgent action to conserve and sustainably use our oceans, seas and marine resources (Sustainable Development Goal 14), achieving the 2030 Agenda will be impossible. Balancing habitat conservation with human use is key for successful fisheries management. Empowered small-scale fishers and their communities can serve as important stewards of their marine resources.  WWF supports a co-management approach that values the roles and contributions of fishers and local authorities. We believe this is the most effective way to restore fish stocks, protect marine biodiversity and secure better livelihoods for Mediterranean fishers and their families. By empowering fishing communities – through better access to decision-making processes, stronger legal representation, and increased recognition within society – we want to end years of mismanagement that created a culture of non-compliance and unsustainability - and ultimately led to overfishing.",

The uprising was against rampant felling of trees and it originated in Chamoli, Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and soon reached other states in India. Villagers hugged the trees to prevent them from being felled. The name ‘chipko’ comes from the word ’embrace’. The movement is variously called 'Embrace the Tree' or 'Hug the Trees'.","The Chipko movement exemplifies 'transformative change' for multiple reasons:
a. It laid the foundation for modern environmentalism in India
b. It was guided by the Gandhian philosophy of non-violence and entailed people simply hugging trees to prevent them from being felled - this form of passive resistance appealed to the masses and it quickly spread elsewhere in India.

As a result, illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing is one of the biggest threats to ocean sustainability. By its nature, it’s impossible to say just how much IUU fishing takes place, but it’s a big problem: the FAO estimates that it accounts for 11–26 million tonnes of fish each year, worth US$10–23 billion. Tackling this would make a big contribution to restoring ocean health and making fishing sustainable – and Global Fishing Watch offers an important
part of the solution. The data and analysis can flag up suspicious fishing activity – for example, boats entering marine protected areas, or unlicensed vessels operating in another country’s waters. It’s also revealing for the first time the extent of fishing: recent analysis has shown that fishing takes place across more than 55% of the ocean surface, making its footprint by area over four times that of agriculture.",

Together with it, the first organizational forms of the Galician-based production sector was constituted, with a spatial and administrative reordering for mussel rafts and crops. A new reality of the sector was maintained in both the marketing guidelines and the fact of initiating a vertical integration between the mussel industry and the commercialization. Everything was accompanied by changes in markets and strong tensions: derived from red tides that limit the operating cycle and even its profitability and also from the conflicts between the producing and transforming organizations, added to the competition in the markets of other countries, mainly Chile.","The mussels industry with a production that accounts for more than twenty five percent of the fresh product landings from the sea, and the full-time employment of more than 8000 people, is by far the largest productive activity of the Galician sea. The Spanish aquaculture sector produced 329.7 thousand tonnes in 2018 generating a turnover of €719 million, and it represents the largest aquaculture farming industry in the European Union. By far the largest activity in Spanish aquaculture in terms of production is culture of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis). The 244 019 tonnes obtained in 2018 represented 74% of the total Spanish aquaculture production. Harmful algal blooms are often associated with large-scale marine mortality events in this case study, and have been associated with various types of mussels and shellfish poisonings. When harmful algal blooms occur, mussel producers are not allowed to sell their produce until the mussels are fit for human consumption. This can cause significant economic losses to the farmers.",

","The small-scale fisheries sector tends to be firmly rooted in local communities, traditions and values.

Women are significant participants in the sector, particularly in post- harvest and processing activities. It is estimated that about 90 percent of all people directly dependent on capture fisheries work in the small-scale fisheries sector (more than 450 million people).

throughout its entire distribution range,leading to a full fishery closure between 1994 and 2008. However, the stock was unable to recover in the short to middle term from the mass 
mortalities, not only at the local level but also at the regional level. As demonstrated by the scale and magnitude of these events, mass mortalities were not related to fishing activities, but resulted from a range of putative factors including a long-term increase in sea surface temperature, harmful algal blooms, environmental stress, and parasitism. The selection of the yellow clam fishery to operationalize the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) (with the previously adoped co-management system; Co-M) showed a highly positive response in abundance and biomass of the harvestable stock through time, stabilization in individual sizes above the minimum landing size limit, and a fairly constant exploitation rate at low levels that did not exceed 25%, accompanied by relatively constant CPUE values through time.

Further increase of marine aquaculture production will probably involve expansion into more exposed oceanic locations, but to what extent is uncertain. Marine aquaculture may also expand further on land in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Moving offshore is one way to reduce coastal stakeholder conflicts, environmental concerns, and to access better water quality. However, the solution to pollution should not be dilution but wastes should instead be seen as resources.It is most likely that offshore farms will be much larger than current coastal farms resulting in significantly more wastes being generated at each farm site. These wastes should be seen as co-products and resources to be utilized in a circular economy framework. It could be anticipated that even offshore farms could exceed the environmental assimilative capacity if increasing in size. There is, however, limited understanding regarding the links between offshore and coastal oceanic processes and, therefore, scientific research should closely accompany the development of offshore aquaculture and IMTA. IMTA may provide an alternative for making use of waste products and transforming these into valuable co-products, while, in addition to increased product profitability, other benefits and services may also be generated by the integrated extractive species.

To achieve this it was important to establish a sustainable supply and value chain for fuelwood. They were also working with local communities to

for rice production. The Sakalava and Vezo ethnic groups rely on fishing, rice production, and animal husbandry, while they lack of organizational and technical capacity to properly
manage natural resources; and this is worsened by inadequate governmental authority to address issues such as migration, land tenure conflicts, low literacy rate, access to markets, health and education services. Since the recent discoveries, oil and gas development will
be also an emerging issues for the all the Western coasts of Madagascar. The very high values of mangroves which underpin the Menabe/Melaky region’s economy offer a sound
justification to empower local communities and civil society organizations. Previous WWF’s work in the area has facilitated the establishment and increased ownership of successful
community-based mangrove management. Apart the increased human pressures linked to growing human vulnerability, climate change is also a new threat to mangroves and is likely to affect the productivity and conservation values of these unique ecosystems. The development of community-based mangroves management has the potential to reduce degradation and uphold the integrity of mangroves, while addressing the socio-economic
needs of local populations. In addition, promoting the implementation of adaptation
measures will help to strengthen the resilience of mangrove ecosystems and the local communities who depend on it.",

The app was designed to generate reliable real-time information and is easy to use so that anyone within the supply chain, regardless of their role, can easily access and share information. Approximately 200 fishermen have been testing WWF's TrazApp in Peru and are now actively digitally recording and reporting their catches. It is helping to hold fishermen and others involved in the process to account and decrease the flow of illegal, unreported and unregulated fish products flooding international markets. TrazApp can also provide useful data on fish stocks that can be used to make important assessments, improve fisheries management and aid conservation efforts. Peruvian fishermen who successfully adopted this mobile application and used it to comply with Peruvian regulations were able to apply for fishing permits. Many did so for the first time and those who obtained those permits were finally able to fish legally in the waters they had worked in all their lives. TrazApp is also being adopted as a safety tool for fishing communities. The app tracks a fisher's location and gives their loved ones the ability to know the departures and arrivals of their trip, which can be useful for long journeys. 
 ","Paper forms and handwritten records still predominate in most data collection and reporting systems used by fisheries around the world. Among Peru's small-scale artisanal fisheries, even these simpler recording methods were largely non-existent. Some 62% of the artisanal fishing fleet in Peru does not have a valid fishing permit, making it difficult to verify the origin and legality of products. With increasing international demand for Peruvian seafood products, particularly from the United States, more Peruvian fisheries are seeking to align with increasingly stringent international requirements and standards for seafood products to ensure their sustainability. Beginning in 2016, perico (mahi-mahi or dorado) and pota (giant squid) fishermen in Peru formed artisanal fishing cooperatives and began working with WWF on fishery improvement projects to comply with Peruvian regulations in hopes of obtaining fishing permits that would help them sell their catch in Peru and abroad. To comply with these government regulations, fishermen would have to adopt a catch documentation system to record their catch and share this data with the government. To facilitate the flow of information, WWF co-developed a mobile application called TrazApp with fishers, the government and other supply chain actors, and has been training fishers in three fishing cooperatives in northern Peru: La Tortuga, La Islilla and San José, to use it.

The Sea Around Us is an international research initiative and a member of the Global Fisheries Cluster at the University of British Columbia. The Sea Around Us assesses the impact of fisheries on the marine ecosystems of the world and offers mitigating solutions to a range of stakeholders. To achieve this, the Sea Around Us presents fisheries and fisheries-related data at spatial scales that have ecological and policy relevance, such as by Exclusive Economic Zones, High Seas areas, or Large Marine Ecosystems.","All spatialized data are visualized either graphically or mapped, and all data can be downloaded. Global fisheries catches from 1950 to the present are available, under explicit consideration of coral reefs, seamounts, estuaries and other critical habitats of fish and marine invertebrates. The data presented, which are all freely available, are meant to support studies of global fisheries trends and the development of sustainable, ecosystem-based fisheries policies. In the early 2000s, members of the Sea Around Us uncovered that China was overestimating its catches and showed that, when such distortions were removed from overall fisheries catches, global fisheries were actually declining since the late 1980s. The Sea Around Us also showed that the biomass of large fish in the North Atlantic is one-tenth of what it was only a century ago. Aquaculture, according to another study with members from the Project, cannot be expected to compensate for overfishing but is instead likely to exacerbate the problem due to the reliance on wild fish for fishmeal.In other words, without serious long-term planning, the oceans might get a lot worse before they get better. In 2016, members of the Sea Around Us, using reconstructed global catch data that combine officially reported landings data with comprehensive estimates of unreported landings and discards, documented that, from 1950-2010, global catches were around 50% higher than reported data suggest.

The development goals of the Plan are: By 2025, the quality, efficiency and competitiveness of fisheries will be significantly enhanced, the supply capacity of aquatic products will be steadily improved, the industrial structure will become more reasonable, the green development of aquaculture will achieve positive results, the conservation capacity and level of fishery resources will be further improved, the foreign cooperation of fisheries will be carried out in a pragmatic manner, the infrastructure and equipment conditions of fisheries will be significantly improved, and the modernization of fishery governance system and governance capacity will be significantly improved, fishermen 's sense of well-being and security will be significantly enhanced, with stronger fisheries, better ecology, richer fishermen and more beautiful fishing villages.","To achieve the goals by 2025, the specific objectives are identified. Industrial development objectives include: The total output of aquatic products will reach 69 million tons, the domestic marine fishing output will be controlled within 10 million tons, and the fishery output value will reach 150 billion yuan, and the income of fishermen will increase significantly. A number of national demonstration areas for healthy aquaculture and ecological aquaculture and coastal fishing port economic zones will be built, and the qualified rate of veterinary drug residue monitoring of aquatic products from national origin will be more than 99%.

In terms of green ecological objectives, the fishing moratorium system will be further improved, and the total management of marine fishery resources and the fishing quota system will be promoted in an orderly manner. The discharge of tail water from intensive aquaculture such as ponds and factories will meet relevant management and control requirements. Compared with 2020, the number of marine fishing motorized fishing vessels in the country will achieve negative growth. A number of national-level marine ranching demonstration areas will be built, more than 150 billion units of various aquatic fry and precious and endangered species will be released for stock enhancement.

In terms of governance capability objectives, China will fully implement the planning of aquaculture waters and beaches and the aquaculture license system, and promote the improvement of the aquaculture environmental supervision standard system. The construction and management of fishing ports will be comprehensively promoted, the list of fishing ports will be released, the formulation of port regulations will be completed, and the comprehensive fishery supervision system relying on fishing ports will be basically completed. The management system of fishing vessels and fishing gears will be improved, fishery law enforcement and supervision will be strengthened, and the ability to participate in global fishery governance will be significantly improved. According to the Plan, China will actively participate in and support the work of the international community in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, actively participate in the negotiation and consultation of global international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations, and fulfill international obligations responsibly.

Closed seasons in all of China’s fisheries along its coasts have been extended by a month, to three to four months, and over 100,000 vessels without the necessary registrations have been confiscated. Meanwhile, alongside controls on total overall catch, provinces are starting to put total allowable catch (TAC) systems in place for certain species of fish. The 14th FYP period will see more TAC systems rolled out. Distant-water fishing will not be the main driver of growth in China’s seafood output, but it is an important part of upgrading the industry. And, in a way, it is part of China’s diplomacy. China has inked fishing deals with 20 nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and has signed up to eight regional fishery management organisations. China even has also hopes of using the Belt and Road Initiative, overseas operations of fishing firms and the UN’s South-South cooperation project to export leading and environmentally friendly aquaculture approaches to other nations. ","Limiting wild catch and reducing vessel numbers has been at the heart of China’s fisheries policy since 2017, when provinces were told how many vessels to take off the water. By 2020, 40,000 working vessels had been taken off Chinese coastal waters, from about 270,000 in 2015, and the total catch reduced to just under 10 million tonnes, down from 13 million, according to the China Fishing Industry Yearbook. This was the first time wild catch had been below 10 million tonnes since 1995. During that same 2016–2020 period, China started piloting systems determining total allowable catches, and allocating these across vessels. Given the continued limits on wild catches laid out in the 14th FYP for fisheries, the planned increase in seafood production will need to come primarily from aquaculture. If China is to improve compliance with international treaties, it will have to implement fishery conservation measures that are in common international use. China’s first distant-water fishing vessel only set sail in 1985 – but it now has over 2,700. As the fleet has expanded, disputes have become more common. As part of efforts in 2016–2020 to formalise fishing activity, China required vessels to comply with international fishing treaties and established a system for assessing compliance. It also put China’s first voluntary closed season on the high seas into effect, for squid fishing, and for the first time sent observers to monitor trans-shipments on the high seas.",

The joint management committee explores opportunities for reversing the socio-economic impacts arising from the fishery.  Additionally, this closer monitoring of the fishing activity has enabled reducing the illegal harvesting and black market of the “sonso.”

Fishers state that a greater empowering in the making of decisions by the sector and the establishment of harvest quotas has improved the fishery’s efficiency.  The fishing efforts have been reduced and, therefore, there are fewer expenses, which means a net increase in the benefits.

Artisanal fishing in Península Valdés with an origin that dates back to more than 3,000 years, practiced using rudimentary techniques and tools by the original Tehuelche settlers. At present, three fishing modalities exist which employ at least 120-130 fishers: beach seining, coastal gathering of mollusks and shellfish diving, all of which require a fishing permit issued by the provincial Fisheries Secretariat. The scallop diving fishery operated with minimum regulations (a size limit and a fishing season) during the 1970-80s and co-existed during a few years with scallop dredgers and trawlers until they were banned because of its impact in the bottom communities. The fleet expanded (to about 40 boats, many unlicensed) in the mid-1990s under a licence system that did not put a cap on effort, until the fishery collapsed in 1995. The fishery remained closed for three years and reopened in 1999, when the provincial fisheries administration created a technical advisory committee with representation of the local fishers’ organization (Asociación de Pescadores Artesanales de Puerto Madryn [APAPM]), scientists from a federal institute (Centro Nacional Patagónico [CENPAT]), and staff from three government branches from the Chubut province: fisheries, tourism and protected areas. The committee recommended the implementation of a limited-entry programme that privileged fishers with a history of participation in the fishery. The new system establishes that permits are granted to boat owners who receive an equal share of the scallop total allowable catch (TAC). The fishery is subject to limited entry (21 permits); entry/exist rules have recently been formalized. Permit holders must be registered, active fishers (physically onboard), with at least three years of residence in the province, and comply with administrative requirements (e.g. tributary, maritime authorizations). Permit holders have exclusive rights for commercial diving for scallops and other molluscs in the San José Gulf. Diving and coastal gathering are the only methods permitted for harvesting molluscs; no industrial fishing is allowed within the gulf.","The scallop management system and the way fishers, scientists and the administration have been cooperating since the creation of the new technical advisory committee with representation of the local fishers’ organization generated a transformative space for actors to create new pathways of change. A provincial registry of artisanal fishers has been established to document participation of all crew members. Scallop harvests are currently regulated through a TAC, a minimum legal size and a season. Scallop surveys are conducted annually with participation of fleet units, scientists and technical staff from the provincial fisheries administration. Results are discussed in joint meetings, and an annual TAC is agreed upon, which is divided up in equal shares among permit holders.

Organized fishers participated actively in the elaboration of its Management Plan, which led to the listing of Peninsula Valdés as a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site in 1999. This designation gave an important boost to the tourism industry, bringing thousands of national and foreign tourists, attracted by the spectacular beauty of a practically uninhabited territory and its wild fauna, especially the high concentrations of southern right whales and other marine mammals and birds that breed in the gulfs and coasts. Tourism is currently the third or fourth highest income-generating activity in the province.
The participation of the fishers in the elaboration of the Management Plan increased their entrepreneurial capacity and made them aware of the responsibilities and benefits of operating within a Protected Area. They became conscious that their products deserved to be distinguished for coming from a wild area with unique natural characteristics. Despite numerous attempts to improve marketing, they have not been able to obtain a certification of origin for their products, nor have appropriate marketing mechanisms been promoted by the government.
The local community has learned to appreciate the role of artisanal fishers as providers of good-quality seafood, worthy of a gourmet table. But the increased visibility of artisanal fishers has its other side. There are actors within the tourism sector who do not see artisanal fishers as allies but rather seek to expel them from the Protected Area. The confrontation with some of the local landowners for access to the beaches has been escalating and increasingly intimidating actions have been used against the fishers. Fishers are united in their struggle to defend their right to a decent and safe work but the lack of effective public policies leaves room for such excesses. Although support is emerging from various sectors of the community, the State has not exercised the mediating and facilitating role that it should in order to build forms of mutual collaboration and defend fishers’ legal right to operate within the Protected Area","Some of the current key current challenges: The most pressing challenges are the lack of public policies designed to strengthen artisanal fishing as a productive activity, and that conceptualize the sector as an ally of environmental conservation and the activity as a tourist attraction for the region. Additionally, the State does not act as a mediator in the face of power asymmetries between sectors. Landowners are powerful within Península Valdés, having access to decision-making spaces and great influence over public officers.
The high rotation of government officers does not allow a full appreciation within the State of the realities of artisanal fisheries; nor does it allow the articulation of short, medium and long-term projects as new staff in office tend to start all over from scratch when considering new strategies for the artisanal sector (Source: Piñeiro, M.(2021).

At the heart of whether in-situ conservation could be pursued as a fruitful strategy of keeping important germplasms alive is whether it generates farm level benefits that are internalized by farmers. This paper assesses the contribution of crop diversity to farm-level productivity using farm-level panel data from the Central Highlands of Ethiopia. The study is conducted in a setting where environmental conditions are difficult due to poor soil quality and challenging weather conditions. Therefore, of special interest is the impact of rainfall abundance on productivity and its interplay with crop biodiversity. ","Farming is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. Understanding farmers' incentives to grow diverse varieties and local cultivars are critical to the success of in-situ conservation. in-situ conservation is the conservation of plant materials in surroundings where they have developed their distinctive properties. Since in-situ conservation takes place on farmers' fields, it is viable only if it generates sufficient farm level benefits. Hence, determining the appropriate cost and benefit of keeping species on farmers' fields is an important step in designing in-situ conservation efforts. Assessing the contribution of crop biodiversity to productivity is thus one way of measuring this benefit. The issue is of particular importance in countries like Ethiopia.

This result is stronger when rainfall is lower. Henceforth, this result provides further (and more robust) empirical evidence on the relationship between productivity and crop biodiversity. This indicates that in a challenging production environment, farmers' reliance on crop biodiversity is very important. The productivity analysis was complemented by the study of the determinants of crop biodiversity at the farm level. Results suggest that rainfall and household endowments tend to govern crop diversity decisions. When farmers expect harsher environmental conditions, they use more diversity to reduce the risk of crop loss and maintain the productivity of their agroecosystem. Land tenure security seems to play a very important role in determining farm-level diversity. Policies aiming to strengthen land tenure security may therefore foster in-situ conservation of resources; resources that are crucial to improving the productivity of food crops.","In the context of global migration due to climate change, it seems important to me to take into account the food security of the populations in the affected areas.

This broadens the understanding of seeds and demonstrates socio-cultural constructions that have a strong symbolic meaning that transcends the biological aspects of seeds. Seeds - in an immaterial sense - are part of people's social and cultural constructions, forming in turn part of a body of symbolism, meanings, and ideas. The defense of seeds, as an aspect of territorial defense, implies the care and protection of one's own, as well as of life itself. In this way, the social reappropriation of territory can deepen the scale of agroecology. 
Obstacles faced by communities include lack of land, unequal market competition, the effects of agrochemicals on health and the environment, natural phenomena such as droughts - perhaps accentuated by climate change - that have intensified in recent years, and the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ","This third concept of scaling up agroecology is interesting, but even more important is the relationship between the three aspects in which scaling up must take place in the search for food sovereignty. How horizontal, vertical, and depth scaling should be articulated to implement actions that will last over time and change the course of action. ",

The Project established a foundation of microbial resource center and transferred technology of isolation and handling of useful microbial resources to Indonesian side. The indicators of the Overall Goal are expected to be achieved in 3 to 5 years after the completion of the Project by the effort of Indonesian partners. The microorganisms isolated and identified by the Project are expected to have high potential to be utilized for agriculture, environment conservation, fishery and many other industries and expected to create the social profits. On the other hand, a remarkable impact of the Project is the awareness raising for values of the microbial resources by Indonesian side. The Indonesian government has recognized the necessity of microbial resource center to promote the utilization of microbial resources for sustainable economic development and improvement of quality of life in Indonesia. For this reason, InaCC building with adequate equipment was constructed by Indonesian government. The Project largely contributed the process of the establishment of the center. It is considered as one of the significant achievement of the Project.

1.	Great efforts of the Project members for construction of InaCC

Deputy of BAPPENAS, Chairman, Deputy Chairman for Life Sciences and Principal Secretary of LIPI  visited NBRC to observe the advanced BRC in Japan and they clearly recognized the importance of the microbial resource center in Indonesia. The Japanese experts and RCB-LIPI researchers took a great effort to convince them and coordinate their visit to Japan. As the results of their visit, budgets for construction of InaCC had been secured and InaCC was set up finally. Thus, the Project members’ great effort led to the realization of the construction of InaCC.

2.	Professional network between Japanese Experts/Researchers and Indonesian Researchers

I have heard that Japanese Experts/Researchers have kept long-term research activities with researchers, LIPI before the Project started. I have thought that the results of this professional network building is one of reasons led to the success of the Project.
","I am not sure whether above challenges described in Q-22 have been overcome in the example, but I wish that utilization of the outputs/outcomes of the Project and smooth implementation of the ABS system in line with the Nagoya Protocol, CBD would lead to overcome some of challenges in Indonesia and global level.",

The   LIFE-ND aims to address the growing numbers of restive youth by sustainably enhancing incomes and food security, and creating jobs for young rural people and women in the Niger Delta. The project is builingd on the successes of earlier IFAD-supported projects to develop the supply of skilled youth labour, and it will strengthen the capacity of institutions at the state and community levels to work with private sector actors.
LIFE-ND has in its component, Environment and Climate Change resilience and Nutrition. Therefore, agroforestry is considered a support towards nutrition, environment and climate change mainstreaming which is a sub component under the LIFE-ND Project.
Agroforestry provides an option for strengthening climate change resilience, while contributing to food access, income, health, and environmental stability. Agroforestry has potential for supporting nutrition while strengthening the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Production needs of farmers need not end with just improved yields and profitability alone, it is also important that environmental sustainability, climate resilience and nutrition be factored into the overall production consideration for community food security and improved livelihood.

Fewer shrimp are being caught, but of larger caliber, which increases profits and reduces environmental impacts.

Fishermen detected in 2005 an alarming decrease in catches, as well as in the size of the shrimp, so they promoted a package of measures to reverse the situation. They began to apply them in 2008 and, five years later, a ministerial order made the conditions to be met to fish shrimp with bottom gear a standard. The plan has been a success. Fishermen caught 96 tons of shrimp in 2017, 19 less than in the previous year and 46 less than in 2013. Revenues, however, have grown and last year stood at 3.6 million compared to 3.2 million in 2016. To reduce the impact on the marine substrate, nets have been more selective and only trawls with a minimum opening of 45 millimeters are allowed, although fishermen have gone even further and use 50-millimeter nets.

The new co-management successfully allowed an increase in the volume of catches while, at the same time, women improved their income and social conditions due to the creation of Shellfisheries Associations, moving away from an uncontrolled and marginalized activity, to a professional shellfishing, one that now have to pay taxes to ensure the benefits of the social security system.
Although these changes have been institutionalized within the new governance regime, the shellfishing activity is currently under several anthropogenic and social pressures which are putting at risk the capacity to build resilience.

","Yes, I want such an example to motivate others","Shellfish gathering has historically been considered marginal, as a complementary way to increase household incomes and performed without real administrative control. It was characterized by technological backwardness compared to other related activities, reflected in an aging workforce, high feminization, scarce professional and technological training, lack of investment, all which resulted in poor marketing, poor internal cohesion of the sector, and overexploitation of most of shellfish species. During the 1960s–1980s, coinciding with a general increase in the number of shellfishers, market demand, and economic value of shellfish species, the regional administration introduced step-by-step new regulations to rationalize and manage the activity. Although these changes have been institutionalized within the new governance regime, the shellfishing activity is currently under several anthropogenic and social pressures which are putting at risk the capacity to build resilience. The increasing market pressure due to the high national and international seafood demand is driving shellfishers to harvest Japanese carpet shell (Ruditapes philippinarum), an invasive species with better resistance to deal with environmental changes which has been introduced in the 1980s in Galician bays. From an ecological perspective, the health of shellfishing grounds have been affected by a combined and cumulative impacts of overfishing, long-term degradation of key habitats, increasing poaching, IUU (Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated) fishing activities, and growing exposure and sensitivity to extreme events, leading to an increase of vulnerability to social-ecological crisis such as the COVID19 pandemic (Villasante et al., 2021).

From the socio-economic view, the shellfisheries sector has been substantially increasing the volume and value of the Japanese carpet shell, growing from 0.41 thousand tn and €3.7 million in 2001 to 3.3 thousand tn and €30.5 million in 2019 respectively. While increasing landings of the Japanese carpet shell have been positive for shellfishers to deal with the lower resistance of native clams as well as to ensure economic revenues over time, developing a strategy toward a monoculture production by concentrating most landings in a single species can be risky in a rapidly changing environment.

Social drivers such as the intergenerational gap between old shellfish women and the new shellfishers (which included men for the first time), the lack of interest of new generations to get involved in SSF, and current conflicts derived from new and less experienced shellfishers entering the fishery are currently affecting the co-management procedures. Galician shellfisheries are also facing indirect drivers such as loss of local population, increasing tourism and gentrification, impacts of economic crisis, delocalization of companies, and lack of labor opportunities for young people. Under this new scenario, local shellfish producers need to compete in a highly competitive and uncertain global seafood market, facing a higher risk of financial bankruptcy over time.","Vision: Fishing and shellfishing have an important social aspect, constituting a vital source of food, employment, recreation, trade and economic well-being for populations, both for today's and future generations, and therefore, in their regulation, measures must be adopted to guarantee the well-being of fishing communities.

It consists of a floating barrier that directs the plastic waste towards a conveyor belt, which then lifts the waste out of the water and into a storage unit on shore. The system is powered by solar panels and is designed to operate 24/7 with minimal supervision. The Interceptor is capable of collecting up to 100,000 kg of plastic waste per day, depending on the size of the river and the amount of plastic waste in it. The waste is then sorted and recycled or disposed of properly. The project was founded by Boyan Slat in 2013, with the goal of cleaning up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a massive area of ocean that has become a dumping ground for plastic waste. While the Interceptor system is not designed to clean up the Garbage Patch directly, it aims to prevent more plastic waste from entering the ocean by intercepting it before it reaches the open sea.The Interceptor system has already been deployed in several rivers around the world, including the Klang River in Malaysia, the Cengkareng Drain in Indonesia, and the Rio Ozama in the Dominican Republic.

The MPA covers 133,000 square kilometers (51,352 square miles), surrounding the Galapagos Islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off Ecuador’s coast.The marine reserve is home to a wide range of species: whales, dolphins, albatrosses, sharks, sea lions, penguins, fur seals, rays, cormorants, marine iguanas, sea turtles, and tropical fishes. More than 2,900 marine species have been monitored, according to the Galapagos National Park Administration.","Since its creation, the GMR has contributed to the conservation of the marine species and ecosystems of the Eastern Tropical Pacific, being key to the economy and food security of the human population living in Galapagos. Commercial fishing is allowed in some areas of the reserve. The lobster and sea cucumber fisheries are important sources of income to the local population, and fishermen from Ecuador regularly travel to the area in search of dorado, shark, and tuna.More than 100,000 people visit the Galapagos every year. Tourists are attracted to the clear water and the opportunity to interact with the archipelago’s unique wildlife. Some areas of the reserve allow sport fishing and other activities, such as snorkeling, scuba diving, boating, and whale watching. Divers are drawn by the large populations of rays, hammerhead sharks, and whale sharks.In November 2021 the Government of Ecuador announced the expansion of the reserve by 50%, adding 23,000 sq mi (60,000 km2) to protect submarine mountains northeast of the islands as the Hermandad Marine Reserve. It will connect with the protected area around Cocos Island.Migratory corridors are particularly important around a remote island group like the Galápagos, where international fishing fleets from China and other countries prowl the waters just outside of protected areas. However, protecting an ecosystem as diverse and remote as the Galápagos goes well beyond restricting industrial fishing. Many other human-caused threats such as climate change and plastic pollution challenge the success of the Galápagos Marine Reserve, and the impacts of climate change grow every day. The greatest challenge to the future success of the Galápagos Marine Reserve may be climate change. The productivity and abundance of endemic species (found nowhere else) in the Galápagos depends on the upwelling of the Equatorial Undercurrent off the west coast of the archipelago.

In this regard, it has been scientifically proven that the catches of commercial tuna species per net set almost doubled in the areas surrounding the GMR, thanks to a spillover effect. This phenomenon occurs when species migrate from an area where they have been protected, with the aim of allowing them to grow and/or reproduce, to an area where they are allowed to be caught, once they have reached a greater number or size. However, this effect is diluted as they move away from the GMR. Despite these achievements, the current size of the GMR has not been sufficient for the conservation of highly migratory marine species, and those that feed beyond protected waters. Prior to the creation of the GMR, knowledge on the conservation status of key migratory marine species was very limited. However, we now know that out of a list of more than 20 threatened species belonging to this group, more than half have worsened in conservation status since 1998, according to the IUCN Red List.
IUCN Red List. Only one species, the olive ridley turtle, has improved its conservation status.
In addition, the Galápagos Marine Reserve faces a number of environmental threats. The most pressing threats to the GMR come from over-fishing and illegal fishing. Some animals are always illegal to hunt in the Galápagos. The legal local sea cucumber and lobster fisheries are heavily depleted and may be close to collapse. This poses dire consequences for the oversubscribed fishing sector in Galápagos, likely causing local fishermen to turn increasingly to illegal practices, such as shark finning, overfishing of tuna, and illegal export of sea cucumbers.

From Qinghai in northwest China to the coastal city of Shanghai, it flows through 11 provinces and municipalities, and enters into the East China Sea at Chongming Island. There are more than 4,300 kinds of aquatic life living in the river, with over 430 kinds of fish species, 170 of which are rare. As a cradle of freshwater fisheries, the Yangtze River serves as the original breeding ground of numerous economic fish and the world’s most important freshwater biological gene bank. The implementation of the 10-year fishing ban compensation policy in the Yangtze River basin -the largest river in China- is the first practice of the river ecological compensation project in the country, which has a milestone value to protect China’s ecological sustainability and boost green development.","The overall catch decline during the periods of habitat degradation and overfishing was found to be about 350,000 tons in a comparison of differences between 2002. A rough estimation suggests that habitat degradation likely contributed to about 70% (based on the catch difference between 1954 and 1978) of the total decline and overfishing the remaining 30% (the catch difference between 1978 and 2002). The contribution of overfishing could be even less than 30% if taking into account the effects of chemical pollutants, which were exacerbated after the re-form and open-up policy. Therefore, it is foreseeable that the implementation of Ten Year Fishing Ban (TYFB) will at most lead to a recovery rate of 30% of aquatic animal resources; for example, a fish catch of around 160,000 tons can probably be expected after the termination of TYFB in 2031.A 10-year fishing ban in the key waters of China's Yangtze River basin has achieved solid progress in ecological conservation, with aquatic bioresources gradually recovering. In addition, the current key results of the TYFB compensation policy are threefold. (1) Policy implementation has significantly raised retired households’ livelihood capital index; (2) The households livelihood capital coupling coordination degree has significantly improved, and the capital structure has transitioned from imbalanced to coordinated; and (3) Households’ livelihood capital exhibits a high mobility, and the gap between rich and poor has been narrowed.

The fishing ban cannot be achieved by the fishery authority alone, and joint efforts from other relevant departments are crucial. Based on preliminary results (Wang et al. 2022 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22009074#s0070) there was a trend of increase in maturity but decrease in complexity. This indicated that a flood phase connection scheme will not fit with the “ten-year fishing ban” policy, and may even lead to food web simplification in sluice-controlled lakes. Because there is the market demand for wild fish and shrimp from the Yangtze River, it is still difficult for people to resist the temptation of earning more money. The government has begun to strike a severe blow on illegal operations as well as the processing and sales of illegal catch, thus cutting the chain of illegal fishing in the Yangtze River. The resettlement of nearly 300,000 fishermen, most of whom are up in years, less educated, and have no other skills apart from fishing, presents another severe challenge. With the compensation funds, some fishermen have bought houses, moved their families to urban areas, or opened up small businesses; others have built up fish ponds to develop ecological farming to meet the rising demand for freshwater fish after the strict and long-lasting ban was put in place.

",Vision: The ban on fishing is a key action to reverse the deterioration of the ecological environment and is of great significance for the protection of the river and the green development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt.,

In the case of community and artisanal fishing, they are left aside in the face of the state's prioritization of industrial fishing. Geographic isolation, cultural differences, mainly linguistic and religious, as well as the lack of knowledge of their rights as citizens, the political system and public administration, make these peoples and communities an impoverished, disempowered and particularly vulnerable social sector.

In addition to being an activity of self-consumption for the Rama people, fishing is also an important commercial activity, mainly for the women who sell a large part of their catch within the communities and in the city of Bluefields. It is important to point out that a major disadvantage faced by the Rama in developing their commercialization activities for fishing, agriculture and forestry is the lack of constant and public transportation in the Territory, which has made them dependent on intermediary traders who buy their products at very low prices. In the case of fishing, in particular, they also lack refrigerated storage units or a stockpile to prevent the fish from deteriorating and to make direct marketing viable.

The Kuna Yala Community is one of the five indigenous comarcas existing in the Republic of Panama. Located in the northeast of the country, its administration is subject to its own spatial regime established in Law 20 of January 31, 1957. The Panamanian government recognizes the right of the Kuna people over their lands and their traditional culture. 
The sea is the reality that surrounds them after they are supplied with the fruits of ""Mother Earth"". In it they fish, dive for lobsters, admire the river floods, watch the dolphins jump, and perceive mermaids and devils. At the table, fish accompanies farm products. It provides 80% of the animal proteins in the Kuna diet. In terms of fishing, most of the traditional fishing practices in the Kuna Yala region are based on the Kuna cosmovision of the mainland, and on the fishing practices that the Kuna people used to carry out in the rivers. Traditional Kuna fishing has a low environmental impact. They generally use small boats (canoes) made of wood in coastal areas no more than twelve to fifteen miles away, within what is known as the territorial sea. The catch is generally oriented to supply local consumption, extracting moderate quantities of fish, shellfish, mollusks and crustaceans. The Kuna obtain most of the animal protein they consume from these systems.

The push comes from outside the indigenous society, but the Kuna participate, by action and omission, in the squandering of resources for money.

A recent study highlights the success of the Tsleil-Waututh approach to fishing as the abundance of salmon in Burrard Inlet remained stable over at least 1,000 years (Morin et al. 2021; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00154-4). These systems were rooted in traditional laws, cultural and spiritual beliefs, and management practices that promoted sustained abundance and access to wild salmon by limiting the risks of overharvest and population collapse. Indigenous salmon management practices offer lessons and options for fostering resilient salmon fisheries as socioecological systems. Salmon possess biological traits that confer a remarkable ability to cope and recover from change. However, salmon are a part of a rapidly evolving socioecological system that has, at times, shown low resilience as evidenced by collapsed populations and fisheries. Stories of Indigenous mismanagement or periods of scarcity, and contemporary examples of dysfunctional cogovernance do suggest the importance of not overeulogizing Indigenous management.

","Yes, I want such an example to motivate others","In Canada (and the United States), Indigenous management of Pacific salmon was painfully and intentionally disrupted beginning in the mid-nineteenth century and replaced by colonial government authority. This transformation fundamentally altered the scales, methods, and locations of salmon harvesting, stripping rights and jurisdiction from Indigenous people and beginning a struggle for access and governance authority that continues to this day. However, many modern salmon fisheries are struggling to provide sustainable social, economic, and ecological benefits; for example, in Canada, the number of commercial licenses has decreased, catches have crashed, and many salmon populations face conservation risks. Despite the destructive impacts of colonization, Indigenous culture and knowledge are resurgent in Canada and the United States. Salmon remain integral to the food security, cultural practices, health, and economy of Indigenous peoples. Although different legal and societal circumstances have contributed to this resurgence across North America, Indigenous communities are increasingly responsible for the management of fisheries, and stewardship of lands and natural resources within their homelands. Amid this ongoing transformation there is increasing recognition that Indigenous knowledge and management systems can contribute to restoring the productivity and resilience of aquatic ecosystems and fisheries.",Vision: Tsleil-Waututh’s community vision is to be able to eat marine food from their territory and practice ceremonies in clear water. Long term stewardship goals include restoration of Burrard Inlet in an effort to achieve this community vision.,

It was created and is governed and managed by Maasai people. The Conservancy covers a 1,214-hectare triangle that serves as a critical migratory corridor for wildlife from the Mara and the Serengeti and it is home to 3,000 people. The Conservancy represents a mixed-use commons where people and wildlife can thrive together. Since it was created in 2016, the area has experienced a remarkable return of wildlife, including threatened and endangered species, and livelihood opportunities have been created for Maasai families.  The Conservancy has initiated numerous successful community development projects, and the model has inspired other initiatives.","This is a new model of conservation that is community-based and recognizes the wisdom and power of Indigenous and local knowledge to protect wildlife and ecosystems. It began as a collaboration across eight villages that came together to agree on conservation practices and regulations on their land, including the removal of 25 km of fencing. They have also initiated programs to promote traditional land-use practices, establish agricultural cooperatives, enhance water security through river restoration, educate girls, and end gender-based violence and discrimination. They have also established a Ranger Patrol Program to monitor wildlife, providing livelihoods for locals, including former poachers. Their initiative and mission to conserve wildlife, preserve culture, and reverse poverty has been supported through crowd funding and grants. This model represents a paradigm shift that supports community resilience, self-determination, and regenerative sustainability. In contrast to traditional approaches to conservation run by outside organizations, the Nashulai Maasai Conservancy is an Indigenous paradigm that ensures that communities directly reap the benefits of conservation. It is based on values such as co-existence, dignity, inclusivity, self-determination, empowerment, and human rights.  It is a model that can be replicated and scaled in different contexts, and it is rapidly becoming a transformational movement. Communities from across southern Kenya and northern Tanzania are joining Nashulai to create what will become the longest connected wildlife corridor in East Africa. The Nashulai Cultural Training Institute already works with communities around the world who want to learn from this model. The Institute aims to be a leading knowledge and capacity development hub in Kenya for indigenous led approaches to ecosystem and social well-being.

It challenges traditional models of conservation funding in several ways. First, the community itself initiated it and found the resources for the conservancy through crowd funding, in contrast to relying on NGOs and government donations. Second, it emphasizes the community’s relationship to land based on the and what happens to life on the land, rather than merely the size of the conservancy. Third, it extends conservation beyond conservancies. Although conservancies receive much attention, they represent only a small percent of the land. Nashulai mobilized communities in the region and worked with them based on principles of trust. It can be considered a small initiative with a big impact. Their approach enables people to stay on their land, recognizing that human and social capital is on the land, and that coexistence is necessary and possible. Finally, Nashulai pursues alternative models in all aspects of its work, from training guards to educating young. Based on values, trust, and the principle of co-existence, it represents a next-generation model that is creating and enabling an ecosystem for sustainability.

It would provide some numbers to satisfy the quantification as well as addressing the population issue. First, the exponential grow over the past century has certainly transformed the world.  The ‘Day of Eight Billion’ was marked on November 15, 2022. Yet the pace is slowing. In the medium variant, the global population is projected to grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 10.4 billion in 2100 in the UN’s middle scenario . However, secondly, historically dramatic falling population growth also provide an example of transformative change.  The population growth rate has decreased ever since the 1960s, a trend that has been increasingly apparent in recent decades. The world population grow rate was 2.1 percent per year in the late 1960s. In 2020, the growth rate had fallen below one percent, but still adding 78 million people in 2022.   and is expected to continue to fall to a negative numbers at the end of the century. This demographic transformation will happen differently across the world, of course. More than half of the population increase up until 2050 will occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. If is bound to fundamentally change the world’s societies as fewer people of productive age will support an aging population. 

The UN population projections depends on several uncertain factors. They hinge on  estimates of the range of plausible future trends in fertility, mortality and international migration in different places around the world, as well as ‘optimistic’ assumptions about the progress of socio-economic development, health, and gender equality.  The scenarios may change due to warming world, increased geopolitical conflicts or slowed socio-economic progress for poorer regions. will affect these assumptions.

The literature on the drivers of the population transition is rich, is not in full agreement, and reveals some important cultural variations. Nevertheless, it typically emphasises improved levels of income, human security, maternal and child health, education, gender equality, access to contraceptives and to some extent coercive policies in some countries in the case of PR China’s one-child policy.

","Yes, I want such an example to motivate others","A gradual change observed in the TAPESTRY research site is to move from community based to community-owned and led means of growing the salinity tolerant rice. The local farmers have discovered over 50 indigenous seeds that used to be grown in Sundarbans before the advent of HYV of seeds through the Green Revolution. The farmers’ cooperative is trying to decrease its dependency on outside actors (both state and non-state) and become self-reliant by having community-owned seed banks and salinity testing centres.

The political, social and economic power dynamics of development, including the vested role of no state and state actors in advocating neoliberalism, will continue to be constants and perhaps will intensify in the climate change frontiers. But community-led transformative initiatives bolstered by people’s movement and alliances with their bottom-up approaches provide a people’s counterpoint for an alternate route to transformation with its promise of being just, equitable, and the potential for scaling up and out.

TAPESTRY project has been able to open up the knowledge exchange pathway among academia, civil society and practitioners between India and Bangladesh Sundarbans. to learn from each other about transformative initiatives and more importantly what works and what does not. This is one of the major legacies that the project has left behind - in seeing Sundarbans not through two different nation-states but as a single continuous ecosystem.

In scientific and policy discourses in Kutch, Gujarat (Western India) the dependence of pastoral and fishing communities on mangroves is cited as one of the major threats to the survival of mangrove habitats. Scientists argue that overgrazing, 'unscientific grazing patterns' (camels browsing on leaves and damaging the tree) and cutting are responsible for the destruction of mangroves. By contrast, herders vehemently oppose this discourse and talk of the synergistic relationship between the camel and the mangroves or cheria as it is commonly known in Kutch.  Our work in Kutch mapped out some of these contestations at the micro and macro levels. Our initiative took place at a crucial juncture when camel rearing is said to be witnessing a revival. The kharai camel, a threatened indigenous species of camel that can swim, has been recognised as a distinct breed (2015) by the Government of India. To protect the kharai, the camel breeders association (KUUMS) and Sahjeevan have partnered with dairy cooperatives to mainstream camel milk production and supply. To sustain this network of milk collection, it is important that conservation of traditional grazing routes is restored and existing natural resources base, i.e. fodder resources and waterscape, including mangroves habitats on which kharai breed are dependent, is protected. The underlying hope was that this mainstreaming will lead to the achievement of twin goals: preservation of the kharai-mangroves co-existence as well as livelihood improvement bringing wider benefits to the pastoral community. Thus, this initiative is critical for the revival of pastoralism especially since mainstream development and conservation debates have denigrated pastoralists and their livelihoods for several decades (see Mehta 2005; Mehta and Srivastava 2019). Drawing on the project’s line of inquiry, we asked: how these bottom-up initiatives are conceptualised, contested and negotiated? What is their potential for triggering transformative capacity? What are the trade-offs and synergies in the process?; and what are the implications for equity, socio-cultural and environmental justice? ","Through interdisciplinary work, we were able to challenge dominant cause-effect narratives about socio-environment relations that also structured power relations. Work on mangrove cover in Kutch combined natural science (remote sensing and participatory mapping), with social science (oral history, interviews) and arts-based approaches to understand pastoral camel herders’ perceptions on mangroves and grazing patterns. This helped to challenge existing entrenched views on the negative effects of camel grazing on mangrove health and thereby counter and reframe narratives that have denigrated pastoralism. the co-produced knowledge bringing together scientific and herder perpectives validated herder grazing practices and also demonstrated that camel/ mangrove relations are synergistic and that grazing can help biodiversity , not undermie it.

Pastoralists gained scientific insights and data to validate their grazing routes and relationships with coastal resources such as mangroves.  1.	There is no singular imaginary of transformation. Transformation is plural and needs to be seen as a contested process of radical change for seeking alternative futures. 
2.	Transformation as a process is better facilitated when it is bottom-up, spatially and gender just and contributes to agency and livelihoods enhancement. It is important to centre the voices of local communities while being attendant to heterogeneous power relations within and across communities.

In fact, a new orientation to the strategy of biodiversity conservation is born through article 8J of the Convention, which takes a broad cultural dimension. It is stated that the multiple cultural perceptions of nature must be taken into account to ensure its conservation. Article 8J of the Convention on Biodiversity states that "" Each contracting Party shall, as far as possible and as appropriate: Subject to national legislation, respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge, innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge innovations and practices "". 20 years after the Stockolm conference and the MAP program of UNESCO, which has as a specificity, very original at the time of its creation, to promote sustainable development (designated at the time under the term of ""eco-development""), to reconcile a good conservation of the environment and the continuation of the human activities which are deployed there, Article 8J of the Convention on Biodiversity discusses the conservation and use of available natural resources and recognize the role of indigenous knowledge in this dynamic.","The new idea that has emerged with Article 8j is that of relying on and drawing inspiration directly from indigenous communities, who cohabit with biodiversity. Thus, in order to save biological diversity, each contracting Party shall respect and preserve cultural diversity. It is no more only a question of biodiversity, but a question of biodiversity and culture. This article 8j marks a turning point because even today, during the creation of protected areas and the reflection on their management, the actors, notably the indigenous communities, appeal to this article. Its use was sometimes made to give good conscience to the decision makers but it (8J from this convention and others in the same way) is also (more and more?) used by indigenous people to negotiate and remind institutions, the State and others, of the need to recognize the knowledge of indigenous people and their role in management. The change has not been radical in all parts of the world, nor has it been constant/consistent (although excluding people from protected areas is less common, it is still sometimes the choice done). Nevertheless, it has in many places instituted a deep change in values as well as in institutions, leading to a better preservation of human-nature relations.

","As a synthesis of my previous comments.
We have to be very careful with the traitment of the database beause from my understanding it is very complicated for each of us to evaluate/give a note to the major impacts of TC. ""I don't know"" is the most real and honnest answer that I can often give. For example, assessing the number of people or the type of habitat impacted or the economic consequences is very subjective. Sometimes, there is a combination of positive and negative impacts in the same area and we cannot make this point or in any case it is subjective. I'm not comfortable but I don’t know really how we could do without having a longer questionnaire....The important thing is at least to be very careful when using these data, to be very nuanced.

The indicators provided in the STECF-Ad hoc-23-01 report show that in the NE Atlantic (both EU and non-EU waters), stock status has significantly improved since 2003 but that many stocks are still overexploited. Among the stocks which are fully assessed, the proportion of overexploited stocks has decreased from around 74% (2003-2008) to 26% in 2021. In the Med A large majority of the stocks remain overexploited (in 2021, 41 out of 57 stocks (72%) were overfished). In terms of fishing pressure, in the NE Atlantic EU waters, the model-based indicator of fishing pressure (F/FMSY, based on 57 stocks with appropriate information) shows a gradual downward trend over the period 2003-2021. STECF observes a decreasing trend in the proportion of overexploited stocks from 2019 to 2020 but STECF is not in the position to assess whether this change reflects a temporary decrease in fishing pressure, or whether this is a longer- term positive trend.
The data also shows that policymakers are still setting too many catch limits above the levels recommended by scientists, with decision-making suffering from a short-term approach and lower ambition than the policy requires. A long-term perspective – one of the key aims of the 2014 CFP – often took a back seat to immediate political expediency. For example, fisheries ministers continued to set excessive catch limits on the basis that they were a “compromise” between short- and long-term aims or were necessary for unexplained economic reasons. A fair standard of living is only one of the mandatory socio-economic objectives included in the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which the study found to be often overlooked in practice. In one of the most worrying results of the study (between 2012 and 2018), the fleets of 15 Member States recorded net negative profits. While it is common for businesses to experience occasional losses, it is highly unlikely that operations would continue with such results. A lack of public communication on the scientific basis for European Commission proposals on management measures such as catch limits, and the rationale for legislators’ subsequent decisions, too often prevented scrutiny of decision-making by stakeholders and EU institutions, and undermined trust in the process. Jointly managed stocks require more complex decision-making than stocks that are managed by one entity. That increases the need for collaborative improvements, especially in the wake of the UK’s departure from the EU. A positive finding from the analysis was a marked decrease in the number of cases of non-compliance with the CFP (between 2013 and 2018) as vessel inspections increased, indicating that continued investment in fleet monitoring and control is necessary.

1) ""Lo indivisible de lo colectivo"": By 2050, cooperation networks between local actors and short marketing circuits characterise artisanal fishing in Uruguay. Aquatic ecosystems (seas, rivers, lagoons) are healthy, abundant and diverse, surrounded by native vegetation and fauna: indispensable scenarios for the upbringing of future children. Healthy and local food, traditional practices, the use of natural materials and the exchange of information are elements valued by fishermen and diners alike. Time has gained space in the kitchens, and consequently fish consumption has increased on Uruguayan tables. The safety and efficiency of the fishing activity has been improved thanks to the incorporation of accessible technologies. The regulatory framework is adaptive and has opened up new opportunities for artisanal fishing and fishing tourism.
2) ""El “maracanazo” de la pesca artesanal"": Uruguay, 2050. Artisanal fishing is part of a healthy, diverse and sustainable food system, where the circular economy is present in all stages and products. Thanks to the transmission of knowledge from fishers and fisherwomen to children and society in general, artisanal fishing has gained visibility and is an important component of the country's culture and identity. Multiple festivals in different localities of the territory commemorate the day of artisanal fishing in Uruguay. Men and women of artisanal fishing have adopted selective fishing methods and processing has been improved, favouring product quality and good environmental practices. Gastronomy and artisanal fisheries have forged a relationship of trust based on the exchange of information, product quality and commitments on both sides. The institutional framework is efficient and in line with local needs. Artisanal fisheries are managed as a socio-ecological system, where local and traditional knowledge is complemented by technical and scientific knowledge for the management of fishery resources.","Context-specific and solution-oriented collaborative environments, also known as transformative spaces, provide an ideal setting for building inspirational visions which in turn are compasses to articulate and encourage actions in the present toward shaping desired futures. The collective creation of visions –as images or stories– allow for the identification of common goals, the critical appraisal of change strategies and their implications (both rationally and emotionally) as well as the identification and imagination of alternatives –all of which help enhance collective agency. Besides, such visions make opportunities for change more visible or transparent to other actors beyond such spaces  and can lead to alignment in terms of values and goals –necessary for systems-level change. Yet, thinking creatively about the future and beyond dominant –western– ideas of progress and development is challenging, and human cognition restrictions bound possible imaginaries, especially those beyond the status-quo. Sustainability transformations represent not just cognitive or technical but also creative challenges. Leveraging the imaginative and disruptive capacity of artistic and design practicesthe arts paves the way to spark and democratize creativity within such transformative spaces, enable the integration of diverse knowledges and forms of evidence  while allowing participants to explore not only what needs to be created, but also what needs to be dismantled. The example showcases the process of co-producing a series of desirable, plural, and meaningful future visions for small-scale fisheries in Uruguay, framed in a food system perspective. Our results are embedded in a transdisciplinary process aimed at co-creating a transformative space that involves leaders of sustainability initiatives of the local food system, researchers from diverse disciplines, and artists.

The mechanisms behind this shift are unclear. It is plausible that the co-management losers were marginalized and forced out, but qualitative discussions with resource users and BMU leaders did not reveal support for this explanation.

(2023) Resilience for whom and according to what criteria? A systemic approach of adaptations to changes in the Bay of Biscay anchovy fishery. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences (under review)",No,Not applicable,"The system has undergone important transformations following a closure of the fishery from 2005 to 2010. While the anchovy stock has recovered, the fishery system has not returned to its pre-collapse status. An overall reduction in the number of vessels targeting anchovy was observed in the three fleets with regional variability. The main two ports for French pelagic trawlers dependent on anchovy, La Turballe and Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie, demonstrated completely different adaptation trajectories. In La Turballe, fishers mentioned trying new gear such as bottom trawl to target new fish and diversify their species portfolio (e.g., squids, sardines, European hake, seabass, albacore). In Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie, the second most important French port of pelagic trawlers, most vessels were scrapped thanks to national decommissioning schemes – most of the time, this coincided with ship-owners reaching their retirement age. In Galicia (Spain), one of the most important region for the anchovy fishery in the country, behaviors were different. A temporary conversion was often observed in the construction industry, but with professionals coming back in the fishery once the stock had recovered, in the 2010s. In the Basque country, fishers mostly switched target species, for mackerel and bluefin tuna in particular but a gradual change in vessel performance and size (higher average gross tonnage by vessel) has been perceived over the last three decades.

The bay of Biscay anchovy used to be a valuable small pelagic resource with higher price per kilogram landed (about 2€ /kg) compared to other small pelagic fish around the world subject to reduction fisheries (fish oil and fishmeal). Market disruptions resulting from the stock collapse and the fishery moratorium are examined in Figures 8 and 9. Anchovy prices responded very dynamically to the fishery crisis. From 2000 to 2006 when anchovy supply decreased, prices rose consequently (over 300%). Exceptionally high prices were observed in 2006 in both countries (with an average at around 6 €/kg during the period 2005-2009). Indeed, the fishery reopened for a couple of weeks in 2006 and anchovy prices reached a historical maximum of 11.3 €/kg in the Basque country and was even reported being as high as 14 €/kg in France. After the crisis, the system shifted to a new regime; real prices came back to their levels of the early 2000s in France from 2010 to 2016, but continued falling in Spain, and remained lower than average after 2017 in both countries.

Overall, imports of fresh products by Spain decreased over the period, while imports of preserved anchovies saw a marked increase, reaching 10,000 tons in 2021. Responses to our survey highlighted two phenomena that explain this increase in canned product imports. First, Spanish industries established long-term contracts with new import sources. Second, Spanish industries delocalized their production activities, particularly in Morocco: 80% of the anchovy (the largest anchovy, <30 ind./kg) remains in the factories of the Basque Country and Cantabria; the rest of the anchovy (the smallest anchovy, >45 ind./kg) goes to Morocco, and small processing plants had to close, bigger ones were relocated in Morocco because labor cost is five times cheaper there.

Such retrospective analysis can serve as a basis for understanding the long-term responses to important changes in fisheries social-ecological systems, and identifying the role of governance mechanisms in supporting adaptations that maintain sustainable fishery systems in the face of future shocks.

Market disruptions resulting from the stock collapse and the fishery moratorium are examined in Figures 8 and 9. Anchovy prices responded very dynamically to the fishery crisis. From 2000 to 2006 when anchovy supply decreased, prices rose consequently (over 300%). Exceptionally high prices were observed in 2006 in both countries (with an average at around 6 €/kg during the period 2005-2009). Indeed, the fishery reopened for a couple of weeks in 2006 and anchovy prices reached a historical maximum of 11.3 €/kg in the Basque country and was even reported being as high as 14 €/kg in France. After the crisis, the system shifted to a new regime; real prices came back to their levels of the early 2000s in France from 2010 to 2016, but continued falling in Spain, and remained lower than average after 2017 in both countries.

Overall, imports of fresh products by Spain decreased over the period, while imports of preserved anchovies saw a marked increase, reaching 10,000 tons in 2021. Responses to our survey highlighted two phenomena that explain this increase in canned product imports. First, Spanish industries established long-term contracts with new import sources. Second, Spanish industries delocalized their production activities, particularly in Morocco: 80% of the anchovy (the largest anchovy, <30 ind./kg) remains in the factories of the Basque Country and Cantabria; the rest of the anchovy (the smallest anchovy, >45 ind./kg) goes to Morocco, and small processing plants had to close, bigger ones were relocated in Morocco because labor cost is five times cheaper there.
","Yes. In this shared stock fishery, research surveys, evaluation methods and recommendations from French and Spanish scientists are critical to TAC recommendations. The timing of the TAC recommendation is decisive but is susceptible of creating inequalities among countries' fleets due to the marked seasonality in the fishery.",No.,Yes,"Regarding stock response, while stock abundance would usually be considered a key performance metric to measure stock recovery, our survey shows that we also need to consider the condition of fish and fish size distribution, as these are important characteristics for the fishery, in terms of both fishing operations and fish prices. Thus, despite restored biological abundance, the anchovy biomass in the Bay of Biscay has not recovered the characteristics that made its harvesting economically viable pre-collapse. An overall reduction in the number of vessels targeting anchovy was observed in the three fleets with regional variability. The strongest negative impact was for the French pelagic trawlers with a decrease of about 70% of the fleet according to stakeholder’s perceptions. The combination of the change in the biological resource with a loss of market access is perceived as the main cause of the downfall, leading (sometimes) to scrapping vessels, with the assistance in some cases of emergency Community measures (Council Regulation  EC No. 2370/2002). The basque purse seiner fleet reduced its size by 40 % from 2001 to 2009. However, public aids were available for the renewal of fishing vessels until 2004 (Council Regulation EC No. 2798/1999) as well as. 

In terms of fleet adaptation strategies, specific changes were observed  according to gear, location and ports . Beyond changes in the number of boats, fishing activity has also been transformed (e.g., season, targeted species, gear), especially for French purse seiners for which total effort targeting anchovy remained low after the crisis, as most vessels switched main target species. For example, the purse seiner fleet located in Douarnenez, Brittany grew (in particular via the sale of vessels sold from the Saint-Jean de Luz area, in the South of France) and intensified their effort on sardine with ensuing pressure on a stock which has also been impacted by environmental change in recent years. The main two ports for French pelagic trawlers dependent on anchovy, La Turballe and Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie, demonstrated completely different adaptation trajectories. In La Turballe, fishers mentioned trying new gear such as bottom trawl to target new fish and diversify their species portfolio (e.g., squids, sardines, European hake, seabass, albacore). In Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie, the second most important French port of pelagic trawlers, most vessels were scrapped thanks to national decommissioning schemes – most of the time, this coincided with ship-owners reaching their retirement age. 

In Galicia (Spain), one of the most important region for the anchovy fishery in the country, behaviors were different. A temporary conversion was often observed in the construction industry, but with professionals coming back in the fishery once the stock had recovered, in the 2010s. In the Basque country, fishers mostly switched target species, for mackerel and bluefin tuna in particular but a gradual change in vessel performance and size (higher average gross tonnage by vessel) has been perceived over the last three decades. While there was also a reduction in the Spanish purse seiner fleet, it seems that there were fewer scrapped boats overall and Spanish fishing industries seem to have been more robust to changes.


",,"Promoting adaptive governance and management, Promoting sustainable governance and management of seascapes, oceans and marine systems",Yes,N/A,"The anchovy catches in the Bay of Biscay  declined from almost 85,000 tons in the mid-60s to less than 4,500 tons in 1982 after two subsequent drastic declines. Following a similar pattern already reported for other species under the Common Fisheries Policy, TACs started to be exceeded with the development of the pelagic trawler fleet in France. Although setting TACs above those advised by the ICES does not necessarily mean that stocks are being overfished, ICES advised to reduce the TAC for the anchovy to 10,000 tons in 1989. Besides, the scientists advised to reduce fishing mortality on juveniles from 1993 to 1999, as well as close a fishing area with high abundance of 1-year anchovy off the mouth of the river Gironde. But the TAC was kept between 30,000 and 33,000 tons. Despite historically low levels of catches, the TAC was not changed. This illustrates  an apparent mismatch at the time between the general scientific advice which tried to significantly reduce the fishing mortality and political decisions regarding management which demonstrated a certain inertia towards TAC modification. Over the same period, the anchovy stock experienced large inter-annual fluctuations in abundance mainly caused by recruitment variability, driven by environmental factors. Recruitment was low from 2001, and in 2005 was classified as a recruitment failure year. While the stock had started to decline from 2000 onwards, it collapsed by 2005 due to its extremely poor condition, due to this combination of successive recruitment failures and changes in environmental conditions.In response, a fishing moratorium was established from June 2005 to 2010. With respect to stock assessment and advisory processes, while inertia in management decision-making had been observed before the moratorium (the harvest control rule was fixed), the fishery has evolved towards a more effective science-based management. The fishery was reopened in 2010 and the moratorium triggered a change in the management scheme with the development of a long-term management plan and TAC set according to Harvest Control Rules (HCR). From 2010 to 2014, the TAC was established for the period between July 1st and June 30th the following year, based on the current year spring surveys and assessment. This plan was based on a precautionary approach with a Blim set to 21,000 tons. The management plan was revised in 2014: there were important changes in the assessment methodology with the inclusion of a recruitment index from JUVENA  allowing to move the management calendar from July-June to January-December. The STECF noted that changing the management period to January–December reduced the biological risks of the stock falling below Blim and reduced the probability of fishery closure. The information on recruits entering the population in the management year reduces the probability of fishery closure by ~25%, as well as led to a small increase in the quantity and stability of catches (~15%), compared with the management period from July–June.",None,No information available to me,,"Changes in primary sector, Structural transition, Market interactions",,"Market and risk-based approaches that make it difficult to progress biodiversity conservation and restoration measures or agendas., Unsustainable production and consumption patterns",,"An overall reduction in the number of vessels targeting anchovy was observed in the three fleets with regional variability.

","To our knowledge, only few studies have evaluated the social and economic outcomes of a moratorium considering the entire fishery SES, including the processing industries and markets. The anchovy fishery SES thus appears as an insightful example of the short- and long-term socioeconomic negative impacts that could emanate from a fishery closure. Indeed, management measures here have focused on reducing fishing effort and rebuilding the stock biomass, but did not consider the market and processing industries, which have faced severe economic and social challenges. Besides, in this fishery, the quality of the fish (size, fat content) and its catchability (mix) are primordial for the market but are not yet taken into account in scientific evaluations and TAC recommendations. Given their importance for the sustainability of the SES, one could argue that stock-based management advice better account for fish condition. Furthermore, unable to pursue anchovy, French purse seiners turned to sardines, pelagic trawlers turned to albacore and sea bass, while Spanish purse seiners compensated essentially with mackerel and tuna. These fisheries have been affected by this fishing effort displacement, especially, sea bass. Further coordination of the anchovy TAC setting with the development of long-term management plans for other pelagic fish, taking into account the dynamics of these different components of the pelagic system, seem key to meet the objectives of ecosystem-based fisheries management. While, in this case study, fishers who have resisted to the crisis seem to have diversified their catch portfolio (at least the Spanish purse seiners and the French pelagic trawlers) and become more multi-species dependent. Preserving the fish resource within its biological limits has had long-lasting cascading effects in the fishing fleets, the sector and international markets. Social and economic indicators can help understand the global responses of the system. The governance objectives of this system may include resilience for some components while accompanying strategic transformation in other components. The identification of strategic socio-economic objectives for the SES, and their alignment with the management objectives set for managing the fisheries, seem indispensable in order to sustain resilient fisheries systems and assess management performance within an integrated policy framework.

Since 2010, however, the total number of agreements steadily decreased to nine, notably because of difficulties to approve (e.g., Morocco, Micronesia) or renew some of them (e.g., Mauritius, Senegal), but also due to political instability (e.g., agreement with Guinea suspended in 2009).

The coastal region of West Africa has long been considered one of the most fertile fishing regions on the planet. As such, in many of the region's coastal communities, fishing stands out as a vital component of the surrounding ecosystem critical to the economic activities of the citizens. However, recurrent overfishing by illegal foreign vessels is not only hampering the area's sources of income and food security. Over the past few years, the widespread plundering of local fishing grounds by foreign trawlers engaged in illegal fishing continues unabated, leaving indelible marks on the communities. Considering the implications, the current fishing crisis, which has reached monumental proportions, is fast becoming a regional tragedy that must be addressed, otherwise prosperity in West Africa could be elusive. All this at the expense of the local population, leading not only to greater inequity in access to marine resources, but also forcing men or even entire families to emigrate, especially to European countries. Merem et al. (2019) http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.food.20190901.01.html","Although the official objetive is to promote sustainable fisheries in Africa, the reality is that fishery cooperation agreements with the Sub-Saharan West African coastal states are considered by the European Union as purely commercial deals that are designed to maximize access to coastal state fishery resources, secure employment for European harvesting and processing industries and supply European seafood consumption markets at the lowest possible cost.

Sizeable improvements have already been achieved since the first agreements, for example, through clauses related to monitoring, local processing, and employment of local crew. Most of these improvements occurred with the shift from ‘fishing agreements’ to ‘fisheries partnership agreements’ in 2004. However, much remains to be done with the creation of ‘sustainable fisheries agreements’ in the context of the 2012–2014 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. If the EU intends to honor its stated goals, it needs to ensure that its fishing agreements (and subsequent EU fleet behaviour) are equitable, fair, enforced, and do not jeopardize the health of fish resources, or artificially channel benefits towards EU industrial beneficiaries. 

Currently, about 20% of illegally caught fish worldwide comes from waters near The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone. This is because of the presence of the Chinese fleet, the new actor coming to these waters during the last decade, which is transforming not only the African waters but also the global fisheries sector. Most of the fish are caught by vessels from China, which commands the world’s largest distant-water fishing fleet and holds the world’s worst illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing record.","No, this is something to avoid",,,

Furthermore, disagreement over the equity principles persists. Therefore, in this paper we test whether the Market Based Solution (MBS) proposed suggests distributional effects of the ocean benefits, by describing the countries favoured or not, and computing the overall equity change of these benefits before and after implementing the MBS. The paper shows how it is possible to reallocate fishing activities with a social and/or market(s) negative balance. Therefore, the study concludes that the inclusion of the fishing industry in a carbon trading scheme, considering in a non-exclusive way the blue carbon concept, induces a more climate resilient, socially efficient, and equitably balanced fishing activity.
",n/a,"Producing and consuming food sustainably, Promoting sustainable governance and management of seascapes, oceans and marine systems",Yes,"This paper focuses on the fish carbon mechanism: the uptake of atmospheric carbon into the ocean facilitated by marine vertebrates and the transport of carbon from the ocean surface to deep waters and sediments. Marine vertebrates store carbon in the ocean as biomass throughout their natural lifetimes, with larger individuals storing proportionally greater amounts over prolonged timescales. The work presented here concentrates on the full biomass carbon storage of all marine fishes (i.e., blue carbon).
Little research has been done in developing universal operational tools to reach the benefits of achieving the PA climate targets. This paper addresses this issue, showing how the provisions of the PA can be stepped up by using a Market Based Solution (MBS), that is, the opportunity cost of producing one ecosystem service (food provisioning) through its effect on carbon sequestration (climate regulation)13. The MBS scheme of this paper builds a supply curve which represents willingness to reduce fishing, derived from the shadow prices created by entering fisheries into a carbon trade mechanism. It is based on an economic logic of inducing a scarcity value for the right to fish, creating an asset in the form of carbon allowances. This shadow price comes from imposing a price to the fishing fleet’s “de facto” blue carbon initial allowances, calculated as the carbon stored in the fish landed over time. That is, an explicit opportunity cost of fishing from the climate targets perspective is created, although any other trade-off could be considered (e.g., nutritional properties of food or any other ecosystem service). This work builds on computing the fish withdrawal price at which fishing fleets have neutral decisions on whether to fish or to trade their blue carbon allowances. For first sale prices lower than the withdrawal price, fishing fleets will decide not to go fishing, but rather, trade their carbon allowances in the market. The reverse is true for first sale prices higher than the withdrawal price.
",n/a,"Decision making in the context of resilience and uncertainty, Laws/regulations and implementation of public policies",Yes,"The paper proposes the internalisation of shadow prices for harvested fishes calculated through their blue carbon content, while economic efficiency is obtained by allowing the trade of CO2e allowances. This scheme provides the global economy with an alternative for the fisheries sector, which grapples with the complexity to find alternatives to reallocate invested capital. It also induces reducing (over)fishing and contributes to build climate resilience and a more equitable distribution of income from the oceans. The internalisation of the climate effect of fisheries (considering only the blue carbon) would imply a 22%-increase of the average ex-vessel prices worldwide if 2050 climate targets are considered.

The initiative helps to inform all levels of policy-making processes and contributes to empowering fishing communities, their organizations, and advocates to make a strong case for productive, sustainable and equitable small-scale fisheries.","In many instances, small-scale fishery activities are informal and not counted. And because small-scale fisheries are diverse and dispersed, fully measuring their contributions is difficult. Often, information on small-scale fisheries (such as catch, employment, nutritional contribution, and governance arrangements) is not included nor disaggregated in official statistics—neither is it explicitly accounted for when designing national, regional, and global policies. As long as data on small-scale fisheries remains “hidden”, they will continue to be marginalized in policy-making processes, decision making and management. The study ""Illuminating Hidden Harvests: the contributions of small-scale fisheries to sustainable development"" uncovers the contributions and impacts of small-scale fisheries through a multidisciplinary approach to data collection and analysis. The study provides information that quantifies and improves understanding of the crucial role of small-scale fisheries in the areas of food security and nutrition, sustainable livelihoods, poverty eradication and healthy ecosystems. The study shows that small-scale fisheries account for at least 40 percent
of the global catch from capture fisheries and provide employment across the value chain for an estimated 60.2 million people, about 90 percent of the total number employed in fisheries globally. The economic value of these fisheries, however, is only a part of their importance: for example, nearly 53 million additional people were estimated to be engaged in subsistence activities in 2016.

In fact, seven of the world’s top ten fisheries (by volume) target forage—also known as low trophic level—fish, 90 percent of which are processed into fishmeal and fish oil. Over the six decades from 1950 to 2010, 27% or ~20 million t per year, on average, of global commercial marine landings were directed to uses other than direct human consumption. Unsurprisingly, the two countries (Peru and Chile) that have the world’s largest single-species reduction fishery utilizing Peruvian anchoveta are also the largest producers of fish for fishmeal, making South America the world’s leading fishmeal producing region. In addition, catches of small pelagics are becoming an increasingly large share of the total catch from 2009 to 201810 in West Africa (in particular in Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia). In West Africa, there is an increased pressure on small pelagic stocks, including the over-exploited sardinella, due to the expansion of the fishmeal and fish oil industry across the region. To get one kilo of fishmeal, more than 5 kgs of small pelagics are needed. Some artisanal fishermen sell their catches to the factories because they can obtain a better price. In the Senegal fishing town Kayar, an enquiry from the NGO natural Justice showed that a fishmeal factory is buying the basket of fish at 5000 FCFA, multiplying by five the price women fish processors paid before. According to locals, the installation of the fishmeal plants in Kayar has led to several hundred women artisanal fish processors losing their job. Food security is also affected: as the FAO report underscores, in 2020 in Senegal, the gap in fish demand was estimated at about 150,000 tonnes. This industry is further endangering local populations, as the discharge of waste waters and smoke are causing respiratory problems and skin diseases. The consumer market for small pelagic fish is also absorbing less and less pelagic fish to the benefit of industrial processing (unfit for consumption), which is constantly growing.

Fishing is the second most important economic activity for indigenous households and contributes 24% of their income. However, this activity has been affected by factors such as population growth and the introduction of new fishing technologies. This has generated conflicts in the use of the resource and fish scarcity. For this reason, it was essential that the communities exercise their own territorial control mechanisms to address the problems of fisheries governance.

Through collective workshops, which promoted participation and reflection on environmental care from indigenous ancestral knowledge; the study identified that the inhabitants have had 4 agreements since 2016 to protect this water basin. First, the management of the fishing resource, which establishes the species and quantities allowed for extraction, the closed periods, and the control of the commercialization of alevins and ornamentals. Second, on fishing gear, which regulates the use of nets, fishing elements according to the water cycle and prohibits the use of toxic elements and firearms for the activity. Third, the entrance to the lake, which regulates the speed of transit through the lakes and the entrance of fishing boats according to their type; and fourth, the management of the lake and the flooded forest, which regulates forestry extraction.

In relation to the fulfillment of the program's objectives, it was found that the agreements have contributed to the recovery of the lake's environmental quality and fishery resources. A reduction in the time dedicated to fishing activities was also reported, as well as a greater possibility of success of fishing activities with traditional fishing gears. Similarly, the fishing agreement also generated a better situation of ecosystems and more effective control over their territory, better organization for collective decision making, and proper management of nature tourism. The agreements also make it possible to control activities such as timber extraction, deforestation, and even illicit crops that have a direct impact on the ecosystem.
However, the guard's authorities do not have the administrative capacity to manage financial resources or to keep the monitoring system active, so the presence of external resources (e.g. NGOs) and actors becomes important to guarantee the operability and continuity of the territory's own management process, creating a figure of external dependence in local governance.

Fish farmers are more evenly distributed spatially than other value chain actors. From the perspective of average household operated aquaculture land (pond surface), the average farm size in our study zones changed little over the decade, even as the total population of them nearly doubled. The fish wholesale segment has been expanding rapidly. This occurred with a proliferation, especially during the 2000s, of rural fish wholesale markets, and an increase in fish wholesale markets in cities such as Dhaka. Fish trader numbers more than doubled across the four zones, from 14,800 in 2004 to 31,300 in 2014. 
The first (and ongoing) technology change linked to the first product cycle step (moving from niche to commodity) is the shift from capture of wild fish stocks from open waters, to their production in ponds under controlled conditions. the small and medium commercial farms that now dominate aquaculture output are making a transition from the traditional production technologies toward intensification – first by labor and then by productive capital (such as formulated feed and medicines and some equipment such as aeration).
In Bangladesh mainly over the past 15 years, the value chain for farmed fish has commercialized, and it has “lengthened” geographically. This is a typical trend in transformation and modernization of food supply chains, with concomitant inter-province market integration and reduction of transaction costs. Farmers have shifted from trapping wild fish on their farms or buying locally available wild seed in the early 1990s, to stocking hatchery-produced seed in the 2000s. By 2011, 98% of fish seed was produced by private hatcheries.
Hired labor use has increased along with the overall need for labor. Whereas in the early 1990s aquaculture used little household labor as compared to crop or livestock cultivation, commercial forms of aquaculture in Bangladesh now generate higher average demand for hired labor per unit area of land than paddy cultivation, due in part to the long fish cropping cycles and more yield and input use to manage. There has been rapid capital deepening in the form of investments by hundreds of thousands of actors in the fish value chain; apparent in a great jump in feed use, investment in equipment and pond construction, and investments in mills, hatcheries and vehicles. These investments have been made by, and provided opportunities for, a multitude of smallholder farmers and small and medium enterprises throughout the chain. This growth has been oriented toward the domestic market, as very little of Bangladesh's farmed fin-fish is exported.

Sustainability aspects: General preventive measures to restoring biodiversity in enhanced fish production are underway in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has a more limited intensive system of fish culture than other big producing countries, so its potential impact on the environment would be smaller. The lack of adequate labour and technology in hatcheries; the practice of fish processing in the city markets; and inadequate waste management at wholesale markets; are largely responsible for the waste problem in the aquaculture sector. Waste management in aquaculture is not a major issue but the industrial wastewater that contaminates inland surface waters used for fisheries and aquaculture is a major concern. The issue of discharge of wastewater is included in the application for an environmental clearance certificate; existing industrial units must include the location of an effluent treatment plant and its design.

In addition,  the input acquisition supply chain for feed manufacture stretches over long distances. Most dried fish, one of the main ingredients in fish feed, is sourced from marine fisheries in coastal districts of Bangladesh but increasingly also imported from India and further afield, as is soy (another key ingredient). Meat and bone meals, important protein sources for feed, are sourced from the European Union. Much of the equipment utilized in the value chain (e.g. feed milling machines, vehicles, pumps, cold chain equipment) is imported, mainly from East and Southeast Asia, as are chemicals. Moreover, in contrast to the common image of the rural fish market being dominated by small rural brokers, the market has shifted to rural sourcing by large wholesalers based in towns and secondary cities. two-thirds of the marketed volume goes to large wholesalers; again that differs between the North with 68% and the average of the other zones at 54%. Three-quarters of the sales to large wholesalers are affected locally (in the village, union, or upazila). By contrast, local rural brokers have a mere 5% share of the market. Just over a decade earlier fish farmers usually sold their fish to local traders or fish collectors.
Use of medicines and other chemicals, including lime, antibiotics, salt, fungicides, insecticides, and feed additives such as vitamins have increased in line with higher stocking densities and feed use. This has occurred as the incidence of disease has increased and better management has been necessary to maintain water quality within the parameters required for fish survival and growth.

Gender aspects:

In Bangladesh, much of the visible work is carried out by men in both aquaculture and capture fisheries. Female participation is almost absent in large aquaculture government and privately owned farms or fish hatcheries. Despite the benefits which come from women’s participation in aquaculture, it is still much lower than men’s, because of the socio-cultural context. While women’s involvement in managing homestead ponds has given them a stronger voice in household decisions, their empowerment has been limited. A common view emerging from the literature is that small-scale aquaculture is suitable for women because ‘it is largely a homestead-based activity that integrates well with prevailing cultural norms’. aquaculture is often seen as an entry point for supporting women’s empowerment precisely because it does not challenge gender norms. While this approach has had some successes, it has not facilitated strategic transformation in rural women’s status, for instance through enabling married women to control, or at least to have an equal say in, productive assets such as ponds.

A laissez faire policy in terms of crop choice has also been important. However, the direct influence of government and NGOs in “causing” this quiet revolution has been relatively minor in comparison with the investments of millions of farm households and small and medium enterprises. Policies and investments that support a broad enabling environment for a wide variety of businesses (e.g. rural infrastructure development and minimization of regulatory constraints to enterprise start up and growth) will generally be of greater importance than those that aim to solve sector or segment specific problems.

The Solomon Islands National Strategy for the Management of Inshore Fisheries and Marine Resources (2010) identified community-based adaptive resource co-management (CBRM) as central to achieving their ambition of sustainable and secure inshore fisheries and aquatic resources by 2020.

Solomon Islands communities have a customary tenure and governance system, where tribes and clans have ownership of the land and the sea, and communities are governed by a tribal chiefs or community leaders. Access to resources is granted to the wider community (to different degrees) by resource owners. There is widespread agreement among researchers that the tenure system and associated rules are socially motivated to reaffirm or assert power relationships and claims on resources, and did not develop as a result of resource scarcity or the need or intent to manage resources sustainably, which is recognised as a necessary pre-requisite for CBRM.

The CBRM system that is developed is often a hybrid model, based on customary sea tenure boundaries and traditional governance institutions which are modified using contemporary fisheries and resource management tools and ideas based on addressing future food security needs and/or meeting conservation goals. All active communities analyzed have moved backward and forward between phases of transformative changes, deciding on rules and governance structures, implementing and testing these, then redefining them in response to gathering more information or changing conditions. 

The strategic opportunistic approach taken by these young entrepreneurs is an example of how strong agency can help communities navigate change and help to transform social-ecological system. From the five case study sites in Solomon Islands the study shows there is no blueprint to the CBRM institutionalisation processes that occur. It clearly depends on the community context. The processes are not linear journeys and there are periods of rapid change and stability or stagnation. The case studies revealed that sustained institutionalisation and active support of CBRM depended on the types of events that happened at the beginning of the process. The subsequent series of events taken to maintain active support were also important. These events, which can be divided into three component types, were collectively essential for building active support for CBRM within a community: a) Using governance structures and decision-making processes that were perceived to be legitimate through the eyes of the community were both particularly significant b) Spending time garnering support for the CBRM idea through community-facilitated participatory and inclusive awareness raising and dialogue was important for initiating support for CBRM, and c) Selecting and adapting rules appropriate to the situation, respecting ownership of resources and involving the whole community in rule enforcement improved compliance and the acceptance of rules in the community.

Legitimacy, support for idea and rules in use seem important for building active support and creating an environment in which CBRM can have longevity and become normalised, and produce perceived benefits to a community. None of the communities have reached and maintained high levels of active support for CBRM without substantial contributions from all three components.

It seems reasonable to conclude that building transformative capacity for CBRM management systems requires innovation in both governance and management. Such innovations are a bricolage of existing ideas that are recombined for a specific context. In the case of Solomon Islands the innovations in governance used the existing governance system of traditional tenure, leadership and community committees, but hybridised it with new governance approaches, such as seeking formal and legal recognition, building partnerships with conservation NGOs and government, and initiating socio-political change through youth empowerment.

In discussions during the historical context part of the innovation histories focus groups, no community had explicitly recognised an ecological problem with marine resources or necessarily attributed it directly to overharvesting. Communities spoke of there being lower fish and invertebrate catches over time and certain species disappearing from catches. However, when probed about why this was and why they did not address it at the time, it was often attributed to natural variation and a belief that marine resources would ‘come back’, or that fish and invertebrates were ‘hiding’ and ‘frightened’ of spearfishing or nets. This is consistent with other research in Solomon Islands where while local ecological knowledge is very high, key life history attributes that relate to resource replacement processes are largely lacking. However, more research is needed to fully understand this issue.

Equity:

Communities tended to match CBRM to a social problem. For example, in a given community, in the ten years prior to adoption of CBRM, negative social activities such as youth drinking alcohol and causing trouble had become a concern for the community and the leaders. The leaders made a decision to address the effect youth behaviour was having on community cohesion, through encouraging youth to engage in healthy social activities. They converted an area of communal land to a sports field and engaged youth in church activities through providing instruments to start a band. When the youth group visited a neighbouring community for church activities, they dived in their kastom taboo area to harvest fish and invertebrates for the feast, and witnessed an abundance of marine resources in comparison to their own reefs. When they returned to their community and proposed to community leaders they close their community reef, the leaders actively supported the youth primarily because they felt it was a positive step for creating a socially cohesive community, with a strong youth leadership. People from within and outside some communities had started fishing using nets, while others still used pole and line methods. This was perceived as being inequitable given fish were not being shared among the community as it was in the past. The community leaders decided this inequity was a big enough problem to speak to the whole community, who then made a decision together to ban netting to everyone.

Gender:

CBRM aims for high levels of resource-user participation in decision-making and in managing resources. In practice, however, different social groups experience collaborative management approaches differently. The processes and outcomes of collaborative management can preferentially benefit or disadvantage certain sectors of society and can also exacerbate existing power imbalances and lead to elite capture in which public resources are managed in a way that benefit a few individuals of superior social status to the detriment of the larger population. They may also inadvertently exclude or marginalize women (or other groups) from decision-making processes and from the resources they rely upon. Good practices and gender-inclusive facilitation to reach women, men and other groups in societies may increase the likelihood that benefits are equitable and that women and men are more empowered, though they do not guarantee it.
",No information available to me.,Yes,"In all communities with marine closure rules in use  support for the idea of CBRM was solidified and maintained when the community saw the promised beneficial outcomes from the periodic harvest of their closed areas. All communities said that after ‘seeing’ the amount of resources inside the closed area after the reef had been closed, support for the idea within the community grew. In each community the periodic harvest has had direct financial benefits to individuals and the community (e.g. has paid for local church and school activities) as well as indirect benefits (e.g. visiting and paying students come to the community).
",No.,"Promoting adaptive governance and management, Producing and consuming food sustainably, Promoting sustainable governance and management of seascapes, oceans and marine systems",Yes,"Only one community from 5 analyzed took some actions throughout the CBRM process to deliberately change rules instead of solely relying on rules crafted in the initial stages of CBRM. Rule changes occurred in response to perceived ecological or social change. The CBRM community leader, a charismatic member of the community who was appointed to the role by the chief and elders of the main land/reef owning tribe in the community, said they adapted the rules (what to harvest, and roughly how much should be harvested) to perceived changes in size and abundance of target species within the closed areas, and as support for the CBRM idea in the community shifted. However, management decisions were also made in response to economic or social circumstances. A recent example was associated with the lifting of the Government-led bêche de mer moratorium for three months in 2013. Given the high value of bêche de mer, and thus a high risk of poaching on their closed reef, the CBRM leader decided to open the reef to allow community members to harvest bêche de mer for three days. Agreement and support from the reef owners has been a crucial first step for CBRM to progress.

The ability to enforce rules within the community has been problematic and infringement occurs in all communities. Communities are more likely to enforce CBRM rules with people outside their community than with people they know within their communities. Awareness raising and dialogue are often required as part of the preparation for community-led resource management. CBRM appears to require more than a simple transfer of ideas – follow up, facilitation and participation is of key importance. Initial enthusiasm for CBRM ideas appears to require follow-up and regular awareness sessions and dialogue discussions, with the whole community and conducted by the community.The community awareness groups acted as ‘knowledge brokers’ or ‘sense-makers’ for the community by making links between the marine ecological issues and broader community issues and social and economic benefits.

",No,"Incentives and capacity building, Decision making in the context of resilience and uncertainty",Yes,"it is important to note that how CBRM information is expressed, or in some cases ‘sold’ to communities by any external agent (e.g. NGOs, researchers, government) can be influential and have implications for the process and adoption of CBRM. It can introduce particular hopes or expectations, and ways of thinking about CBRM and marine resource management benefits and costs. For example, others have found that over-emphasising a ‘win-win’ scenario and economic benefits of closing areas, can lead to lowered levels of support if expectations are not met or there are inequity in benefits within communities.

This is the vision held by the parent initiative- GreenPop.,"The mission at Greenpop and for the Reforest Fest is to get active and not anxious about the state of the planet. By being part of a movement, and taking on the daily grind of creating a place of bright green mindset, you’re able to get yourself into a place of feeling connected with community, seeing what’s possible with collective action and experiencing the many landscape-based projects that have seen huge success. Reforest Fest is an annual restoration celebration that brings people together to plant thousands of trees while enjoying a celebration for all ages in nature. It’s a festival for everyone, grandparents to toddlers. Restoring landscapes is fundamentally about people as much as it is about trees. It starts with connection, shared love and appreciation, and a decision to bravely start something new, often small. But through nurture, directed growth, intentional cultivation, compassion, and dedication, it can flourish into something profound and impactful. Both for our planet and future generations, we foster hope, whatever may come.
Where creativity meets participation, people congregate to enjoy in the diverse array of entertainment with interactive art & theatre for the whole family – all whilst having a blast getting active for the environment, by planting indigenous trees in degraded landscapes. It brings joy, celebration and a sense of community into restoration of landscapes. There have been incredible results. Just recently, in 2023, a camera trap footage, from the Platbos Forest Reserve, captured one of the elusive and majestic Cape Leopards, within the forest that is undergoing restoration activities. in the 11 years its been active (as of 2023) more than 7000 people have participated in the reforestation festival, 16 species of indigenous plants have been planted, 6 people have permanent employment at the UIilenkraal Valley Restoration Project, with 105k trees planted.",Africa,South Africa,Gansbaai,Promoter,,,,,,,,,,,Promoter,,,,,,,,,,"Third sector (e.g., NGOs, charities, social enterprises, voluntary & community organisations)",,2010-2023,Yes,Ongoing,Days,Indigenous plants are planted over the space of a long weekend.

National parks provide durable protection for the planet’s fast-disappearing wildlands. But they also have the power to nurture our well-being and restore our ties to something greater than ourselves. Our vision for a vast network of parks on land and at sea promotes climate stability, restores biological corridors, and provides habitat for native species. Globally proven economic drivers, parks also provide lasting benefits to local communities. This vision is shared between Doug and Kris Tompkins and their initiative Tompkins conservation. ","Tompkins Conservation, founded by Douglas and Kristine Tompkins, is dedicated to conserving and restoring Chile and Argentina’s wild beauty and biodiversity by creating national parks, restoring wildlife, inspiring activism and ecological agriculture, and fostering economic prosperity as a consequence of conservation. Tompkins works to create ecologically grounded local economies; local, renewable energy production; thoughtful, place-appropriate architecture and design; and meaningful work for individuals and communities. Over the past 25 years, Tompkins Conservation has invested $345 million in extensive protected areas in Argentina and Chile through its local affiliate Conservación Patagónica. To date, Tompkins has created six national parks, with five more currently in progress. The initiative is transforming the landscape to be more wild, biodiverse, and resilient. They are building networks that can allow for faster and deeper changes for the SES. They are affiliated with other organizations (like government bodies and other community-based or private organizations), this can allow for a protective space for experimentation, i.e. a protected niche or proto-regime, which can then make changes to the greater system or regime.  This initiative stepped up to restore natural areas and in doing so reinstituted cultural values and values for nature. The initiative has increased employment in the area and thus also increased standards of living. They are integrating the social and ecological, through restoration activities driven by science, education, and community outreach.  This is a great model for place-based environmental stewardship, which can lead to a few transformative changes.  For the stakeholders and community members it can lead to an inner transformation of values towards nature and human-nature connectivity (scale deep).  It can be a model for stewardship of natural areas which can then be replicated elsewhere (scale out).

Second, the city focused on small wins rather than being over-ambitious. Suitable technical solutions were found to different issues.

The intelligent transport system combined the URBS’s operations centre and other data sources, such as video detectors and a surveillance system, to develop a dynamic traffic plan that evolved with the traffic. The operations centre monitored the city’s fleet of 2,500 buses in real time through on-board computers, GPS modules and sensors, which collected information including bus location, adherence to schedules and estimated travel time, sending it back to the operations centre each minute.

The Center for Humane Technology (https://www.humanetech.com/podcast/the-ai-dilemma) highlights several aspects that could generate undesirable consequences on different groups of our societies. For example, they state the following key problems and challenges:

1) Half of AI researchers believe there's a 10% or greater chance that humans will go extinct from their inability to control AI. When we invent a new technology, we uncover a new class of responsibility. If that technology confers power, it will start a race - and if we don’t coordinate, the race will end in tragedy.

2) Humanity’s ‘First Contact’ moment with AI was social media - and humanity lost. We still haven’t fixed the misalignment caused by broken business models that encourage maximum engagement. Large language models (LLM) are humanity’s ‘Second Contact’ moment, and we’re poised to make the same mistakes.
‍
3) Guardrails you may assume exist actually don’t. AI companies are quickly deploying their work to the public instead of testing it safely over time. AI chatbots have been added to platforms children use, like Snapchat. Safety researchers are in short supply, and most of the research that’s happening is driven by for-profit interests instead of academia.
‍‍
4) The media hasn’t been covering AI advances in a way that allows you to truly see what’s at stake. We want to help the media better understand these issues. Cheating on your homework with AI or stealing copyrighted art for AI-generated images are just small examples of the systemic challenges that are ahead. Corporations are caught in an arms race to deploy their new technologies and get market dominance as fast as possible. In turn, the narratives they present are shaped to be more about innovation and less about potential threats. We should put the onus on the makers of AI - rather than on citizens - to prove its danger.","Most probably yes, as there are potential unintended consequences of the use of these tools in terms of property rights (high tech companies potentially creating monopolies, for what purposes is being used, the energy used to run these technologies, etc.)","Yes. For instance, we heart about the arrival of GPT-4, OpenAI’s latest large language model (LLM) release. GPT-4 surpasses its predecessor in terms of reliability, creativity, and ability to process intricate instructions. It can handle more nuanced prompts compared to previous releases, and is multimodal, meaning it was trained on both images and text.

The initial ruling in 2015, requiring the government to meet an emissions goal of 25% reduction from 1990 levels by 2020, was upheld through the Supreme Court on appeals, affirming that reduction in emissions was necessary for the Dutch government to protect human rights.

Years later, each summit (Montreal, Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, through Paris and the latest convention in Madrid) expanded the commitments of the signatory countries to reduce their carbon footprint. So much for the theory. In many cases, however, theory and reality are quite different. In practice, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in November 2019 that only 20% of the 184 countries that had committed to cut plans in the Paris Agreement were on track.  Even the Paris Agreement, signed by 195 countries in 2015 to limit global warming to 2°C by the end of the century, dubbed 'the first binding one', has ""fine print"" that clarifies that it is a hybrid framework agreement between ""general binding agreements and binding contributions at the national level"".",No,"Practicing informed governance for nature and nature’s contributions to people, Conserving, effectively managing and sustainably using terrestrial landscapes, Promoting sustainable governance and management of seascapes, oceans and marine systems, Improving freshwater management, protection and connectivity, Building sustainable cities that address critical needs while conserving nature, restoring biodiversity, maintaining and enhancing ecosystem services, Promoting sustainable energy and infrastructure projects and production",Yes,"The original 2015 ruling against the Netherlands was heralded worldwide as the first successful tort action against a government to address climate change to protect human rights, an area otherwise known as climate justice.  The ruling on the Netherlands case led to similar climate justice lawsuits in other countries, including Belgium, France, Ireland, Germany, New Zealand, Britain, Switzerland and Norway.

On Oct 9, 2018, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld the District Court's ruling, concluding that by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by end-2020, the Dutch government is acting unlawfully in contravention of its duty of care under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. The court recognized Urgenda’s claim under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects a right to life, and Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life, family life, home, and correspondence. The court determined that the Dutch government has an obligation under the ECHR to protect these rights from the real threat of climate change. The court rejected the government’s argument that the lower court decision constitutes “an order to create legislation” or violation of trias politica and the role of courts under the Dutch constitution. In response to these appeals, the court affirmed its obligation to apply provisions with direct effect of treaties to which the Netherlands is party, including Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. Further, the court found nothing in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that prohibits a member state from taking more ambitious climate action than the E.U. as a whole, nor that adaptation measures can compensate for the government’s duty of care to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, nor that the global nature of the problem excuses the Dutch government from action.",No,"Incentives and capacity building, Decision making in the context of resilience and uncertainty, Laws/regulations and implementation of public policies, International instruments (e.g., conventions, UN resolutions, declarations, etc.)",Yes,"A Dutch environmental group, the Urgenda Foundation, and 900 Dutch citizens sued the Dutch government to require it to do more to prevent global climate change. The court in the Hague ordered the Dutch state to limit GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding the government’s existing pledge to reduce emissions by 17% insufficient to meet the state’s fair contribution toward the UN goal of keeping global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius of pre-industrial conditions. The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy. The court did not specify how the government should meet the reduction mandate, but offered several suggestions, including emissions trading or tax measures. This is the first decision by any court in the world ordering states to limit greenhouse gas emissions for reasons other than statutory mandates.","Values, Changes in primary sector, Structural transition, States",,"Views of biodiversity as separate from humans and as such, to be controlled, managed and exploited, Inadequate policies and institutions and their misalignment to redirect capital to biodiversity actions, Policy-related challenges, Unsustainable production and consumption patterns",,No,"This is an example with high transformative potential on food, climate change and health.","Yes, I want such an example to motivate others",,,

The diversity of economic development and revenue-generating
activities pursued by the trust ensures that financing of ongoing
conservation efforts is secured in the short- to medium-term.
Perhaps most central in terms of organizational sustainability
will be continuing to ensure that benefits from the trust and from
its programs reach the community and are perceived by the local
population as positively impacting their lives.Special emphasis has been placed by the trust on working to ensure
the full and active engagement and participation of women in
conservation and natural resource management activities. As one
example, the first female community rangers were employed in
2011, which has engaged local women in the monitoring of wildlife.
Additionally, four of the ten Advisory Board members are women
from the Kuku Group Ranch community. This may not seem overly
significant, but is in fact a relatively progressive achievement in the
context of Maasai traditions. Roughly 46 per cent of the teachers
employed by MWCT are women, with 25 per cent of those coming
from within the Maasai community.",Not available to me,Yes,"The trust supports a number of conservation activities and maintains a conservation department that employs more than 100 local Maasai people. Conservation activities are divided into four
main areas: the conservancy program, the ‘Wildlife Pays’ program,
predator monitoring, and community wildlife rangers. In support of
these and other efforts, the trust has also constructed the Chyulu
Conservation and Research Centre, where it undertakes knowledge
management, research and information exchange activities. Another
activity, currently in the exploratory phase, is the development of
payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes around forest and
water conservation.
The conservancy program: MWCT has developed a model for a
network of land conservancy zones that aims to maintain ecosystem
services on community-owned lands between the two national
parks. This will entail the protection of standing forest, grassland,
and wetlands, among other key landscape features, which entails
local landholders foregoing the use of the land for livestock. The
cornerstone of the trust approach is the negotiation of lease
payments for conservancy zones. To date, the group has negotiated
and secured two such management deals to protect a grassland
habitat reserve and a critical wetland, totalling 12,000 acres, both
of which lie within the migration corridor between the two national
parks. These deals allow the community to be compensated for
their stewardship of the local ecosystem, funding the creation of
alternative livelihood options, which has been important in a cattle-
dependent local economy that increasingly suffers from the impacts
of prolonged droughts. Within its education program, the
trust supports 20 local primary schools and one secondary school,
serving a total of 7,000 students. The trust operates these schools in
partnership with the Kenyan government, which provides support in
the form of schoolhouse construction, employment of teachers, and
the provision of stationery.

This ‘effectiveness’ is based on the estimations that hundreds of millions of births had been ‘averted’ and the penalty of “above-quota-births” was found reducing births in rural China. Chinese scholars campaigned to scrap the one-child policy for more than a decade, on the grounds that the country’s total fertility rate was worryingly behind the replacement rate. In the 1970s, the total fertility rate (births per woman) fell from 5.8 in 1970 to 2.75 in 1979. In the 1980s, the rate hovered above the replacement level of 2.1 that would allow the population to replace itself, but since the 1990s, it has declined to below the replacement level. The 2010 and 2020 censuses yielded total fertility rates of 1.18 and 1.30 respectively. This further fell to an alarming 1.15 in 2021, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics.
By 2050, some analysts predict one in four people in China will be retired and the working population will have shrunk by 10%, with huge economic and social implications.
","The population control program had wide-ranging social effects, particularly for Chinese women. Patriarchal attitudes and a cultural preference for sons led to the abandonment of unwanted infant girls, some of whom died and others of whom were adopted abroad.Over time, this skewed the country's sex ratio toward men and created a generation of ""missing women"".However, the policy also resulted in greater workforce participation by women who would otherwise have been occupied with childrearing, and some girls received greater familial investment in their education.In 2014, for example, The Economist labeled the ‘China one-child policy’ as the fourth largest ‘action’ to slow global warming, estimated at 1.3bn tonnes of CO2. In addition, some studies (https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195925509000250) show that population has the largest potential effect on environmental impact, followed by urbanisation level, industrialisation level, GDP per capita and energy intensity. Hence, China's One Child Policy, which restrains rapid population growth, has been an effective way of reducing the country's environmental impact. However, due to the difference in growth rates, GDP per capita had a higher effect on the environmental impact, contributing to 38% of its increase (while population's contribution was at 32%). The rapid decrease in energy intensity was the main factor restraining the increase in China's environmental impact but recently it has also been rising. Against this background, the future of the country looks bleak unless a change in human behaviour towards more ecologically sensitive economic choices occurs. ","China's population control policies have also been recognized as being effective. This ‘effectiveness’ is based on the estimations that hundreds of millions of births had been ‘averted’  and the penalty of “above-quota-births” was found reducing births in rural China. The one-child policy has been challenged for violating a human right to determine the size of one's own proper family. According to a 1968 proclamation of the International Conference on Human Rights, ""Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children. A long-term experiment in a county in Shanxi, in which the family planning law was suspended, also suggested that families would not have many more children even if the law were abolished. A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.",Yes,"The urban population in the cities was acceptive of the policy, given the already crowded circumstances in urban areas. Incentives offered by the state also were effective to make the urban population compliant with the newly-introduced family planning. Families that signed the single-child pledge and met the requirements of having only one child were given access to housing and daycare, while non-compliant ones would receive penalties. Examples are obstructing the parents' careers and delaying the payment of their salaries.

The rural population was more resistant to the policy: and variations upon the policy were permitted. Mothers of a daughter in several rural provinces were allowed to have a single additional child (a ""1.5-child"" policy) and families in remote areas a second or third child.After collective co-ops were dismantled and decollectivization took place, children became more valued by their parents, as a source of agricultural production, and as a source of the care required by ageing parents. Due to the inherently patrilocal nature of marriage, it was expected that daughters would leave their parents and contribute labor to their husbands' households. The consequent preference for sons came into conflict with the one-child policy and government enforcement of this policy.

The 'Rolling Stone' article was used as the basis for a documentary by Granada Television's 'World in Action' program. The show, called 'Sting and the Indians', was re-broadcast in the United States on the A&E cable network hosted by Bill Kurtis.[17]

The primary claim of both was that the project in Brazil was misrepresenting the facts to donors, as some of the Kayapo's traditional land was already ""protected"" within the Xingu National Park. In fact, the Xingu Park is actually a large indigenous-controlled area, the first in Brazil, so it is an indigenous territory, not a national ""park"". Moreover, the Fund's initial project supported demarcation of the Mengkragnoti Area, which is right next to/contiguous with the Xingu Park, and did not demarcate the park itself.

In 2002, 2003, and 2004 the US branch of the organization was given zero stars out of four by Charity Navigator, primarily because only 43-60% of funds during those years were spent on programs on the ground.[18] For example, in 2008 the US Foundation had total revenues of $1.27 Million of which only $404,000 went to 'Project Payments' according to the Foundation's very own 2008 IRS tax filings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest_Foundation_Fund#Criticisms

Sugar kelp, the type of seaweed grown by GreenWave, is also high in vitamin C, K, iron, calcium, iodine, and magnesium. And humans aren’t the only ones who can benefit from consuming it. Livestock produce methane emissions (a gas that’s damaging due to its effectiveness at trapping heat) equivalent to 7 gigatonnes of CO2 per year, similar to a year of transport emissions. Including seaweed in the diet of cows can help reduce their methane emissions by as much as 82%, with sustainable results and no effect on dairy taste.

In particular, Brand's work in de-extinction has been characterized as ""playing god"" and criticized for taking time and money away from traditional conservation efforts. In addition, many are concerned by the concept of cloning, even in the context of conservation. The topic of de-extinction made media headlines numerous times during the 2010s. In March 2013, Revive & Restore hosted a TED conference called TEDxDeExtinction in collaboration with National Geographic to publicize the conversation on de-extinction. A series of speakers with experience in history and technology related to de-extinction delivered talks discussing how de-extinction would work and why they felt it could become a necessity. Supporters largely saw de-extinction as a way to make up for past mistakes that drove species like the passenger pigeon to extinction while revitalizing ecosystems. On the other hand, critics claimed that de-extinction was inadequate because it would not address many human activities that continue to drive species toward extinction.

Additionally, skeptics such as Stuart Pimm, a conservation biology researcher, worried that species created through de-extinction could actually end up harming a habitat more than helping it. Because the organisms created through de-extinction are not genetically identical to the extinct ones, he suggests it will be hard for an animal to adopt the exact niches that were once done by the extinct species, especially without parents or a herd teaching them social behaviors. Additionally, the ecosystems that those organisms are being introduced into may have already evolved to exist without them. Because of that, introducing new organisms may disrupt the balance evolved in their absence. Lastly, Susan Clayton, a researcher of conservation psychology, among other critics, suggested that if extinction suddenly seems like a reversible process, it may decrease support for conservation because people may believe that they have no responsibility in any further extinctions. For critics like Pimm and Clayton, the risks of de-extinction may outweigh the benefits. 

Although there is a potential risk, as of 2020 Revive & Restore continues to present their ideas at annual international science conferences such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which calls itself a global authority on the measures needed to safeguard the planet.

The field of synthetic biology, which is capable of altering natural genomes with extremely precise editing, might offer the potential to resolve some intractable conservation problems (e.g., invasive species or pathogens). However, it is our opinion that there has been insufficient engagement by the conservation community with practitioners of synthetic biology. We contend that rapid, large-scale engagement of these two communities is urgently needed to avoid unintended and deleterious ecological consequences.  Others disagree, some conservations worry that a focus on de-extinction will reduce the availability of resources from other conservation activities.

Globally, Africa accounts for about 25% of the number of road crash victims, while the continent has barely 2% of the world's vehicle fleet. Nairobi is one of Africa’s fastest growing megacities, with a population of over four million inhabitants. In Nairobi 2.27 million trips per day are made by walking, and 55,000 by cycling. Many people walk and cycle to work, largely due to low-income levels and a lack of available alternatives. Pedestrians and cyclists are faced with several challenges in their NMT journey: from traffic accidents, lack of green spaces and pollution, to muggings, congestion, a lack of footpaths and cycle lanes, and encroachment upon their designated lanes. The majority of these challenges are safety- or infrastructure-related. NMT users account for 66.3% of traffic fatalities in Nairobi. Pedestrians are the
most vulnerable road users, accounting for 64.5% of fatalities in Nairobi, and cyclists account for 1.8% of these fatalities. 88.3% of all fatalities are males. Further investigations reveal that 10 roads in Nairobi account for 55.5% of all fatalities. Private cars, followed by Public Service Vehicles (PSVs), are leading causes of accidents, many of which occur on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Factors that contribute to these accidents include speeding, careless driving and careless pedestrian crossing, lack of pedestrian crossings and poor lighting, among others.Over 3,000 Kenyans die on our roads every year, the majority
of whom are young people between the ages of 20 and 44.6. In Nairobi, pedestrians account for 64.5% of all traffic fatalities, translating into an estimated 320 pedestrians dying annually. Road accidents cost our economy in excess of $50 million annually.

With this new program, more than 80 kilometres of pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths have been constructed in Eldoret under two Bank-funded programmes.

It became infamous for its environmental impacts, which led to a massive movement against its use.It was widely used during World War II to protect troops and civilians from malaria, typhus, and other diseases spread by insects. After the war, DDT became widely used in agriculture. The book ""Silent Spring"" by Rachel Carson, published in 1962, was instrumental in raising public awareness. Carson detailed how DDT entered the food chain and accumulated in the fatty tissues of animals, including humans, and caused cancer and genetic damage. A significant part of the book was dedicated to documenting the detrimental effects of DDT on birds, including bald eagles, whose eggshells were thinned, leading to reproductive problems.Silent Spring"" provoked a public outcry that led to policy changes. It is often credited with launching the modern environmental movement.
In the years following its publication, a grassroots movement demanding the regulation and ban of DDT began to take shape. Civic groups, environmental organizations, and concerned citizens were at the forefront of the movement. In 1972, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a cancellation order for DDT based on its adverse environmental effects, such as those to wildlife, as well as potential human health risks.

","To achieve these goals,they engage retailers, brands, and foodservice companies to drive actions through their seafood supply chains to rebuild depleted fish stocks, reduce the environmental impacts of fishing and fish farming, protect ocean biodiversity, address social issues in fishing, and advance economic opportunities for fishers and their communities worldwide. SFP works directly with seafood companies, influencing them to undertake improvements in their supply chains and to source their seafood products responsibly. The organization does not work with fisheries or farms directly but rather supports and guides the industry to engage in improvement efforts. The Sustainable Fisheries Partnership is unique in its approach by focusing on engaging and catalyzing the seafood industry to drive changes in policy and practice through market forces rather than direct advocacy or consumer campaigns. Their work has been instrumental in many of the successes seen in the sustainability of global seafood markets.

Ecosystem services generated from the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve that will provide value for people include agricultural food production, buffering against floods, recreational services, and educational services. Additionally, the reserve will provide habitat for more than 700 nationally red-listed species. ","The Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve was established in response to environmental change (ie eutrophication and pollution of the water river basin). The key actors realized that the wetlands at the river basin were created as a result of agricultural practices and that they provide many beneficial ecosystem services such as habitat provision and water filtration. In this way, the landscape was understood as created by and significant to both people and nature. The reserve is managed under an adaptive governance approach which conceptualizes landscapes as complex social-ecological systems. The reserve is managed by a municipal organization in collaboration with diverse interests and has acted to connect previously disconnected actors such as local farmers and conservationists. The Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike was created as an on-site educational center to bring together education, cultural heritage, nature conservation, and research. Through fostering local connection with the river basin and mobilizing stewardship of the ecosystem, the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve is transforming the local human-nature relationship to one of mutualism.

The National Population Policy (NPP) 2000 of India was a significant policy initiative aimed at stabilizing the population by 2045 through a variety of strategic interventions. It was developed in the context of India's high population growth at the time and its impact on the environment, economy, and overall development of the country.The results of the NPP 2000 over the years have been mixed, with some targets being met while others remained challenging. 

India’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined significantly since the policy's implementation. While the goal was to achieve a TFR of 2.1 by 2010, this target was not met until later. As of the latest updates, many states have reached or even gone below the replacement fertility rate, but some populous states still have higher rates.
The rate of population growth has decreased over the years, but India’s population is still growing and is projected to surpass China’s population, if it hasn't already by the time of your inquiry. 

There has been a substantial reduction in Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) from the levels at the time of the policy's inception, yet it is still higher than the policy's target of achieving an MMR of 100 per 100,000 live births. Significant progress has been made in reducing Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Under-Five Mortality Rate, but again, the targets set for 2010 were not fully met by that year and progress continues.

The rate of population growth has decreased over the years, but India’s population is still growing and already surpassed China’s population. While India has made considerable progress in several areas outlined by the NPP 2000, the full realization of its objectives is an ongoing process. The policy laid the groundwork for a comprehensive approach to population stabilization, but the results indicate that sustained effort and innovative strategies are required to address the multifaceted challenges of population growth and demographic transition.

As family sizes began to reduce, there was a correlated trend in urbanization with associated environmental impacts such as increased pollution and habitat loss. Reduced population pressure in rural areas was intended to lessen the encroachment on forests and wildlife, helping in biodiversity conservation efforts. However, the efficacy of this has been variable across different regions.

While the NPP 2000 made strides in various areas, the diversity of India's population and the varying levels of development across states have led to uneven impacts. The policy also faced challenges such as implementation gaps, funding constraints, and the need for coordination across various sectors. The ultimate success of the NPP in creating sustainable social, environmental, and economic outcomes continues to depend on ongoing efforts and adaptive strategies in response to emerging challenges and trends.

However, dropout rates, especially at the secondary level, and education quality, remain areas of concern. There have been improvements in women's empowerment and gender equality, including increased female literacy rates and participation in the workforce, although disparities persist.

With a significant emphasis on the education and empowerment of women, there has been some progress in gender parity, although this remains an area where further efforts are needed.

As sterilisation scandals abound, a consensus is emerging for a shift away from sterilisation towards a larger ""basket"" of contraceptive choices and concomitant improvements in service delivery. That such a shift needs to take place is clear, but precisely how it is to come about, and who gets to determine what is in the basket of choices are questions that deserve greater attention.","Population stabilization efforts are still uneven across different states and regions, with cultural, educational, and economic factors playing a significant role.
Quality of healthcare, particularly in rural and impoverished areas, remains inadequate for the needs of a growing population.
The policy faced challenges in implementation, especially with regard to coordinating among various governmental and non-governmental sectors. 

Unusual emphasis has been placed on family planning programs to reduce the population growth rate in India. The results of this initiative have not been good. India's economic system is mired in poverty and illiteracy. India has a female illiteracy rate of 60.61 percent and an overall illiteracy rate of 47.69 percent. In such a situation, relying too much on family planning methods has not worked. Due to unfavorable circumstances, the family planning program has not been entirely successful. Earlier, it was necessary to take supportive steps and create awareness in the socio-economic field. They can mention India's neighbours China and Sri Lanka in this context. The people of these two states are low-income; but among them, the education rate is improved, and awareness of the norm of a small family is widely present. Naturally, the population growth rate in these two countries has slowed down from 1.5 percent to 1.4 percent (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359186187_A_Critical_Analysis_and_Evaluation_of_National_Population_Policy).

Despite being Africa's largest economy and with considerable donor investment in the health sector, Nigeria's health indicators remain among the poorest in the world.The National Family Planning Programme in Nigeria is a critical component of the country's public health policy, designed to address its high fertility rates and the associated implications for health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. 

There has been some progress in maternal and child health indicators, with family planning contributing to lower rates of maternal mortality by reducing the number of high-risk pregnancies.There's potential for increased economic productivity as family planning can result in higher women's participation in the workforce.

Despite its goals, the programme faces significant challenges. Misinformation, cultural barriers, religious opposition, logistical hurdles, and financial constraints can impede the delivery of family planning services.

","The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is a public-private partnership led by national governments with six core partners - the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Its goal is to eradicate polio worldwide. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is an initiative created in 1988, just after the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate the disease poliomyelitis; led by the World Health Organization, it is the largest international public health initiative in history.

Cases began to drop dramatically and are down 99%, with most countries having zero cases. An estimated 20 million children have been prevented from getting polio since the GPEI was launched. When Nigeria was declared free of wild poliovirus in 2020, it was a major achievement: it had been one of the last few countries where the disease had clung on. Wild poliovirus remains endemic in only two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Afghanistan and Pakistan have proven more difficult because of their nomadic populations, rugged terrain and the unfounded notion that the vaccine is a Western tool to sterilize the population.

Without careful consideration of gender, global health programs may fail to meet their required targets or further reinforce gender inequality.https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/the-impact-of-gender-on-the-global-polio-eradication-initiative-key-findings

","Polioviruses grow in the intestinal system and are shed through feces. The infection typically spreads in areas with poor water and sewage sanitation; wild poliovirus is found in this type of environment and puts unvaccinated people at risk.  The study found that gender power dynamics played an important role at home and in the community, in the workplace, and in the GPEI organization itself. The impacts in these areas affected the successful execution of the GPEI’s aim to eradicate polio through vaccination.

The initiative has created awareness and protocols for the proper disposal of medical waste generated by immunization campaigns, reducing potential environmental contamination.Polio vaccines require a cold chain to remain effective, which has driven improvements in energy-efficient vaccine storage and transport. This has broader benefits for other temperature-sensitive vaccines and medical supplies.By reducing the need for wild habitat encroachment (which can occur when communities spread in search of treatment or unaffected areas), the containment of polio indirectly aids in the protection of biodiversity.

Key findings regarding the role that gender played in the GPEI include:

The effect of gender on who receives the vaccine: In some contexts, including within Ethiopia and regions of India, and Afghanistan, the health of boys was prioritized over girls and more boys received the vaccine. In other contexts, however, misconceptions about the vaccine, such as that it would cause sterility in boys, caused more girls than boys to receive the vaccine.

The effect of gender on the successful administration of the vaccine: In many contexts, male polio workers were not allowed to enter households, creating a need to recruit and train female workers who could access homes in conservative areas to administer the vaccine. This increased the number of households reached, but also left areas that are unsafe for women or where women are not allowed to go unreached and thus unvaccinated.

The impact of having females as front-line workers on the community: The use of females as front-line workers delivering the vaccine resulted in the empowerment of women in communities where employment for women was limited, and for many, this was their first opportunity to gain employment in their lives. Female workers were also more likely to be trusted by communities. They were also were able to help other women in the households they visited by raising awareness on other health issues such as intimate partner violence.

The effect of gender at work: Having more female front-line health care workers changed the dynamics of program teams. Since all-male teams were limited in their ability to effectively reach households, there was a need for mixed gendered teams that included both men and women. This maximized access to the communities and in some situations, helped ensure safety of female workers.

The effect of gender on the organization of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative: While women were increasingly engaged for front-line worker positions, there was not a similar emphasis on promoting women to leadership roles, particularly at the global level. This has been reflected in the leadership of the GPEI globally and within countries.
","Vaccine-derived polio has become more common because the oral vaccine in use now protects only against types 1 and 3 of the virus. In 2016, encouraged by the apparent eradication of the type 2 virus, the WHO removed it from the oral vaccine. That move left the world increasingly vulnerable to outbreaks of residual type 2 virus. At the same time, global health organizations shifted from maintaining agile teams that could quickly quell outbreaks to strengthening overall health care systems. Regions struggling to contain polio often have other public health problems, such as poor nutrition, access to clean water, and other infectious disease outbreaks. But responding to a polio outbreak — or other infectious diseases like COVID-19 or monkeypox — requires specific teams and programs, said Kimberly M. Thompson, a health care economist whose work focuses on eradication. of polio.The WHO has missed that goal for decades, “but there is no accountability for performance,” Thompson said. Likewise, countries that receive polio funds rarely take responsibility for diverting the money to other programs, he added. As a result of the dismantlement of outbreak control teams, the vaccine response to polio has often been slow and ineffective. https://www.nytimes.com/es/2022/08/19/espanol/polio-casos-vacuna.html.

A new study (completed 196 interviews globally and within each partner country; 74.5% of respondents were male and 25.5% were female) shows that male polio workers were not allowed to enter many households in conservative communities which created demand for female vaccinators. This changed the dynamics of front-line program teams and workplaces and empowered many women to enter the workplace for the first time. However, some faced challenges with safety and balancing obligations at home. Women were less likely to receive promotions to managerial or supervisory roles; this was also reflected at the global level. Some described how this lack of diverse management and leadership negatively affected the quality of program planning, delivery and limited accountability.

""Despite its ecological importance, the Mayombe
forest, and especially its southern part, was
subjected to decades of intensive degradation,

area rely mainly on subsistence cultivation, smallscale husbandry, anarchic logging, poaching and
fishing for their livelihood. Significant differences in
the levels of degradation of adjacent components of
the Mayombe forest ecosystems and the existence
of transboundary issues resulted with the conclusion

The members of the cortium include the city of Melbourne, Australia Post, National Australia Bank, the University of Melbourne, and Zoos Victoria. It is estimated that the project will reduce Melbourne's carbon emissions by 138,600 tonnes per year. Because the windfarm generates more energy than the purchasing group requires, it will provide additional renewable energy for the market, as well as secure long-term price certainity in the face of increased energy costs. In this way, the initative will benefit climate mitigation measures as well as the wellbeing of people in Melbourne. A second stage of the intiative began in 2020, in which 110GWh of wind power energy, produced primarily by Yaloak South Wind Farm, will be used to power fourteen shopping centres, nine office buildings, seven educational campuses, and four manufacturing facilities across greater Melbourne over a period of 10 years. ",The Melbourne Renewable Energy Project is transformative in that it creates an unlikely partnership among prominent institutions from all over the city. The cooperation of the members of the consortium allows for a much larger investment and therefore a large-scale transition towards renewable energy in the city. The intiative secures a long-term market for renewable energy production that is essential for  the development of large-scale projects.

Keziah Mayer,keziahmayer@gmail.com,No role,Transformative Change,Centre for Sustainability Transitions,,Conservation and restoration of the mangrove ecosystem in The Gambia through the REDD+ mechanism,A Masters Thesis conducted and written by Line Hedevang Nielsen shows the positive effect of mangroves on the biodiversity of zooplankton in our Mangrove and Restoration Project in The Gambia. AND https://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/national-news/gambia-mangrove-redd-project-holds-awareness-forum-for-local-authorities,"Yes, and the vision is explicit","The project’s climate, community and biodiversity objectives therefore are:
1) To contribute to mitigation of climate change through removal of carbon from the atmosphere through mangrove growth and avoidance of emissions through avoided deforestation and degradation of mangrove habitats.
2) To improve livelihoods in the mangrove-dependent communities in the Gambia through increased job opportunities, improvement and increase of available natural resources and overall increase in well-being.
3) Improve environmental conditions, restore ecological services and enhancing biodiversity through restoration of wetlands including mangrove planting and avoided mangrove degradation and deforestation.

This vision is shared between the REDD+ and Verified Carbon Standard project members: Government of Gambia through the Department of Parks and Wildlife Management (DPWM) (who also holds the Project Ownership). The project is implemented by DPWM and the three Gambian NGO’s Sahel Wetlands Concern (SWC), West African Bird Study Association (WABSA) and Kombo Foni Forestry Association (KOMFFORA). Ørsted Nature Based Solutions is another project proponent.","The project is initiated by the Government of The Gambia to secure the long-term sustainability and maintenance of the mangrove reforestation and avoided degradation activities through the certification and selling of carbon credits. It aims to generate greenhouse gas emission removals and reductions through mangrove reforestation and avoided degradation, including wetland restoration and conservation activities. Reforestation will as a start be the main component of the project. Reforestation of degraded mangrove areas will take place in selected locations considering the ecological conditions and with the involvement of local communities, government, departments and NGO’s. The project is designed to actively engage communities in rehabilitation and maintenance activities to ensure ownership and alignment with community preferences as well as contributing to community development. The project also seeks to improve biodiversity.
Generally, the mangrove dependent communities (Approximately 80% of Gambia’s population) and those living adjacent to mangroves are characterized by a rural environment where the most common land use activities are traditional forms of land use, livestock, and agricultural activities (mainly rice cultivation). Human activities such as collection of wood for fuels, infrastructural changes and other anthropogenic activities are important drivers of mangrove degradation in The Gambia, and mangrove restoration activities should and will therefore be addressed in a manner that both contribute to mitigation of climate change, improving livelihoods of the mangrove-dependent communities and increasing the biodiversity conditions.
I believe this is an attempt at transformative change, as the Mangrove social ecological system (SES) of The Gambia was deteriorating: the ecosystem was degrading which thus had a negative impact on the contributions of the ecosystem to the community. In order to stop this in its tracks, the project aims to restore and conserve mangroves in The Gambia. The project will then mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration and storage, enhance biodiversity and have positive rural livelihood effects, including enhanced oyster collection, fishing and fiscal revenues to the participating communities. 

The transformation will be a a more sustainable relation ship with people and nature- where people dont just take from nature but also give back and conserve the limited resource- this transformation is done through a systems approach where scientists and communities, who are empowered through the project, work together to shift the workings of the SES.

mangrove habitat where the mangrove ecosystem is either partly damaged or completely

ecological conditions in the specific area (salinity, tidal regime, mangrove species already
present and so forth). The species chosen will always consist of species native to The Gambia. There is also the  re-establishing the natural vegetation of the areas ( and, where necessary, altering the hydrology to re-establish the hydrology of the once intact mangrove ecosystem.

In this project, there is also an Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation and/or Degradation category thats includes activities that reduce net GHG emissions by stopping mangrove deforestation and/or degradation of degraded to mature mangrove forests that would have occurred in the mangrove forest configuration. Project activities will commence in a later phase of this project and could include the development of alternative activities such as the improvement of agricultural practices, promotion of sustainable agriculture and fisheries and strengthening of technical, financial and material capacities of conservation services. Overall, project activities conserving tidal wetlands are to protect at risk wetlands, maintain or improve water quality, improve water management on drained wetlands, recharge sediment to avoid drowning of coastal wetlands and creating accommodation space for wetlands migrating with sea level rise. These activities can be carried out by establishing conservation easements, community supported management agreements, establishing protective government regulations, and preventing disruption of water and/ o r sediment supply to wetland areas.

Keziah Mayer,keziahmayer@gmail.com,No role,Transformative Change,Centre for Sustainability Transitions,,Nsombou Abalghe-Dzal Association (NADA) ,https://nadagabon.org/docs/our-mission/ ,"Yes, and the vision is explicit","Community-driven, national-scale actions with global impacts that improve human well-being by conserving the traditional ecological knowledge and ecosystems on which we all depend. 
This vision is held by the NADA team: NADA’s origins come from the Community Wildlife Project Gabon launched by the Poulsen Lab at Duke University in 2015, when a team of paraecologists – local community members employed as researchers and community organizers – were trained to conduct wildlife inventories in the forests of their villages (see publications for the results of their work). Their teacher – then and still – was Alex Ebang Mbélé, a Gabonese researcher, conservation leader, environmental educator and community facilitator with 3 masters. At the end of 2018, Alex went to Duke to plan the second phase of the project, and returned to Gabon with a new collaborator: Graden Froese, PhD student at Duke and Canadian social-ecological researcher who has been based in Gabon since 2016 having previously worked in Southeast Asia. ","Nsombou Abalghe-Dzal Association's mission is: Sustainable and equitable governance and management of ancestral lands and biocultural diversity, established and maintained by Gabonese Indigenous Peoples and local communities.

Ancestral lands across the tropics are home to many heritage sites and natural resources such as bushmeat, fish and non-timber forest products that are key to the food, financial, and cultural security of Indigenous Peoples and local communities. But global changes in markets, climate, and extractive industries increasingly harm the land and animals, and in turn the well-being of communities.

And the people who most rely on and know best bushmeat and all resources – rural hunters and their communities – are routinely excluded from genuine engagement in research, policy and wildlife management. Faced with these realities, the time for action is urgent.

An outsider-driven agenda will never be socially sustainable, nor will it enable decolonial ways for western actors to engage appropriately in conservation. Innovative and inclusive interventions are needed for community self-determination, and community self-determination is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable governance and management of ancestral lands and resources.

When this work is led from within, it represents the possibility of truly just and transformative conservation of all biocultural diversity.

NADA currently works with 10 villages actively engaging in actions beyond data collection. 4 of the 10 villages NADA works closely with have begun the process of autonomous wildlife management. With individuals and entire communities acting as integral members of the NADA team, this innovative approach is successfully seeing rural communities setting their own environmental agendas and defining their own visions of sustainability. Some inspiring results include:
1. Villages creating a suite of hunting rules and sanctions, including electing management bureaus and holding regular community-wide meetings.
2. Each village determining its own specific rules including conservation reserves where hunted is banned; spatial rotation of hunting with open and closed areas changing over time; limits on the numbers of animals hunted and frequency of hunts; banning outsiders from hunting.
3.Villages reinforcing their rules with community patrols, and conduct outreach and collaboration with neighboring villages, local authorities, and logging companies.
4. The village that hunted the most at the beginning of the data collection created the most in-depth management system, a suite of nine rules, and reduced their hunting more than any other, by almost 50% – around 750 animals a year.
ommunity wildlife management on this scale is a novel initiative nationally in Gabon, in line with the country’s global leadership for a sustainable planet. NADA is working increasingly closely with Gabonese decision-makers, and through this collaboration is seeing an increase in community participation in national environmental frameworks.

Conserving thousands of animals like this represent not just a win for biodiversity but is vital for a healthy ecosystem both locally and globally. For example, many large tree species rely on hunted mammals to disperse their seeds, and conserving these animals enables the forest to regenerate over time and continue to sequester enormous amounts of carbon, fighting climate change.

Further, as the world increasingly recognizes the ethical and pragmatic importance of indigenous and local peoples stewardship of earth, NADA’s interventions from the local to the global provide tangible ripple effects for other initiatives to learn and grow from, just as NADA has from them.

""Although Central America has coral reefs along both coasts, we began our work on the Pacific side of Costa Rica.  The reefs here are built by a handful of coral species, but they are important because they support a high biodiversity of marine life. They are also proving to be resilient to climate change, so we want to culture these survivors for restoring reefs that can withstand future warming.

Raising Coral conducts awareness and education activities, as well as train coral gardeners wo support them in the cultivation of corals and restoration of reefs- this work contributes to communities income and their connection with nature.

They believe that local communities will feel a stronger pull to steward nature if their connection to nature was stronger and so they are trying to facilitate this connectivity.

Integrity & Consistency: 

Integrity is our cardinal value, a precursor to the trust that society places in any person or organization practicing ecological restoration. For us, congruence between proposed objectives and transparent verifiable actions is a clear sign of integrity. 

Education & Inclusion: 

The fate of coral reefs will depend largely on our ability to educate and raise awareness among current and future generations. Our commitment is to provide information in a concise and transparent manner to all sectors of society. 

Optimism & Commitment: 

An optimistic yet pragmatic attitude towards the current and projected state of coastal marine ecosystems must prevail in all coral restoration efforts. We strive to take and encourage actions that will improve the health of reefs and associated communities.

This movement is built upon a shared vision for increasing and connecting pollinator habitat. Hundreds of Pollinator Pathway gardens have been established in just a few years. It encourages people to rethink their space -- whether that is a lawn, local park, school ground, container garden, or window box. It is an opportunity for connection and local action-to connect with your neighbors, your land trust, garden club, or nature center. By reconnecting our landscape for pollinators, and reaching across town and state lines to connect pathways, we can have a lasting impact.

Rewilding Europe uses a number of tools to support its activities.

European Rewilding Network
European Rewilding Network (ERN) is an online network set up to connect areas in the continent where rewilding efforts are taking place, including both the core Rewilding Europe locations as well as many other sites with externally run projects. Promoting the sharing of knowledge and experience between the many projects and locations is a main goal of the network. The tools ERN uses are Online Seminars (webinars) held quarterly on various rewilding topics. ERN forum, open and free to all members, this online platform is used to post questions and information, interact at any time, and view previous webinars on a wide range of rewilding-related topics. ERN Bridge, is a virtual bridge set up in hopes to close the gap between the needs of the vast numbers of rewilding initiatives with students and volunteers searching to gain experience by working in nature conservation and rewilding. Direct access to Rewilding Europe Capital (REC), Europe's first ‘rewilding enterprise’ funding facility that provides financial loans to new and existing business that catalyse, support and achieve positive environmental and socio-economic outcomes that support rewilding in Europe. ERN members are eligible for a direct access to European Wildlife Bank, a tool designed to facilitate the reintroduction and restocking of herbivores to rewilding areas across the European continent.

Rewilding Europe Capital
Rewilding Europe Capital (REC) is the first ‘rewilding enterprise’ funding facility that provides financial loans to new and existing business that catalyse, support and achieve positive environmental and socio-economic outcomes that support rewilding in Europe.

European Investment Bank provided Rewilding Europe Capital with a 6 million euro loan finance contract. It is the first project of the “Bank on Nature Initiative”, set up by the European Commission. The signing ceremony took place in the Berlaymont Building, headquarters of the European Commission in Brussels. REC forms part of the enterprise component of Rewilding Europe, which is working to build a business case for wild nature in Europe. REC was established to positively stimulate enterprise economies connected to natural landscapes and their wildlife. REC achieves this by providing commercial business loans to businesses that can: positively address negative socio-economic impacts caused by rural land abandonment; directly and indirectly support rewilding processes and activities in Europe and to those which deliver economic returns from nature and wildlife related sectors that also work to conserve natural landscapes, capital and rural cultures and heritage connected to them. By 2018 Rewilding Europe in total loaned out to 18 enterprises the sum of 520,000 euros.

European Wildlife Bank
European Wildlife Bank (EWB) a tool Rewilding Europe uses to help bring back more natural numbers of the original native herbivores in our rewilding areas. These big grazers and browsers play key roles for the natural functioning of Europe's ecosystems. Tauros cattle, native horses and European bison are an example of the species involved in the European Wildlife Bank. European Wildlife Bank developed a database for all the animals in the bank. This includes information on births and deaths in all relevant areas across Europe, the start and end dates of contracts, the yearly availability of animals, and the demand for animals from new rewilding areas. By 2018 Rewilding Europe signed 16 contracts with partner organisations in nine countries.

Rewilding Europe policy work
Titled ""Making Space for Rewilding: Creating an enabling policy environment"" is a policy brief written by Paul Jepson, Course Director at the School of Geography and Environment at the University of Oxford and Frans Schepers, Managing Director of Rewilding Europe. The brief was written with the aim to make rewilding widely acceptable and recognizable as an innovative conservation method. The brief communicates that rewilding as such represents a growing movement in Europe and has attained scientific, practical and media presence. The interviews have been conducted with ten experts from the field of EU nature and legislation and in rewilding to explore the opportunities to create a policy environment which would support fuller expression of rewilding visions and principles.

With the help of this brief, Rewilding Europe works on getting support on enabling environment for rewilding in its nature conservation and land-use policies. Four main targets to be implemented in the EU policy are: 1) recognizing rewilding as a new conservation approach emerging from the inter-disciplinary conservation science interacting with currents in culture and society, 2) positions rewilding as a complimentary approach with the potential to extend the scope and impact of the EU nature policy in a cost-effective manner, supporting better implementation of the Nature Directives and 3) undertakings to support and invest in rewilding initiatives and studies and engage in dialogue with the rewilding movement in preparation for the 2030 biodiversity strategy.

In March 2017, a coalition of five organisations kicked off a new initiative to promote and strengthen the EU ecological restoration agenda. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding, Rewilding Europe, BirdLife Europe,and Central Asia, WWF European Policy Office, the European Environmental Bureau and the German Institute for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), launched this 3-year initiative funded by WWF Netherlands. The overall aim of the project is to strengthen the EU restoration agenda and ensure that specific actions are taken to create a coherent ecological network in Europe, by promoting and using rewilding principles.

Similarly, in 2020, the WWF, The Rivers Trust, The Nature Conservancy, The European Rivers Network, Rewilding Europe, Wetlands International Europe, and The World Fish Migration Foundation have formed a coalition to restore Europe's rivers and streams to their natural state",,"Cross-sectoral cooperation, International instruments (e.g., conventions, UN resolutions, declarations, etc.)",Yes,"on their website under rewildin un action- people engagement:
""People engagement
Effective communication is essential when it comes to changing people’s ways of thinking, building public support, creating positive attitudes and engaging with stakeholders as we work towards a wilder Europe. To this end, Rewilding Europe has always placed great emphasis on reaching out, creating dialogues and involving people from all strands of society. We have now reached out to almost a billion people since we began operating in 2011.

Today our initiative continues to generate a lot of attention, with rewilding as an innovative conservation approach resonating with and inspiring people of all ages and backgrounds.

Podcast series
A new rewild podcast series is to take listeners on an inspiring audio journey across Europe, meeting many of the passionate people and inspiring initiatives currently enabling nature recovery on the continent.

A collaboration between Rewilding Europe and series presenter James Shooter – travelling photographer and filmmaker – “The Rewild Podcast” will bring each of Rewilding Europe’s rewilding landscapes to life, as well as taking an in-depth look at the work of many other leading European rewilding organisations, including members of the European Rewilding Network.

Impact Stories
The European rewilding movement has come a long way since Rewilding Europe was founded in 2011. Over the course of the last decade, rewilding has had an increasingly beneficial impact on landscapes and lives across Europe. A 5-part series of impact feature stories comprises a range of insightful stories, maps and infographics that illustrate how the impact of rewilding has grown.

On the big screen
Films are a great way to showcase our work to the widest possible audiences. We currently work on a new series of short films to showcase and upscale rewilding. The series is produced by White Fox Pictures and supported by Hogan Lovells. New episodes will be broadcast at Rewilding Europe’s YouTube Channel.

Also, on a regular base, broadcasters invite Rewilding Europe to engage in TV productions and documentaries. We have acted on a number of these requests, resulting in several reportages and news items, including a collaboration with National Geographic that led to a 6-part primetime TV series, called Europe’s New Wild.""","Values, Population size, Urbanization",,"Lack of coordination between knowledge and innovation stakeholders, including limited coordination and cooperation of researchers across disciplines, Conforming actions that create a hold on habits and institutions over social life",,,,"Yes, I want such an example to motivate others",,,

The Green Revolution also had a strong
political dimension. Governments made boosting agricultural production a priority and coupled public policies supporting farmers with technology development to address hunger and malnutrition with great success. Yields grew substantially in the subsequent
decades, resulting in nonlinear increases in agricultural productivity.
In the 50 years since the beginning of the Green Revolution, the global population doubled from 3.5 billion to 7 billion people, while cultivated land expanded by a mere 12 per cent.The Green Revolution stands as an example of a tipping point in the transformation of the food system.

This concerted effort demonstrated remarkable success in reducing malnutrition and hunger, though it also led to inequalities and unintended consequences that remain important today.While the Green Revolution brought about nonlinear increases in productivity, it also raised concerns about its sustainability. Since 1990, the rate of agricultural productivity growth has notably slowed, suggesting the possibility of reaching a plateau in productivity in high- and middle-income countries. Widespread use of synthetic inputs and the focus on monoculture farming has led to environmental degradation, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases.
Increasingly subsidised food production, which did not internalise external costs, also led to increased food waste and loss and allowed widespread adoption of diets that are inconsistent with human and planetary health.

They created the hashtag #FridaysForFuture, and encouraged other young people all over the world to join them. This marked the beginning of the global school strike for climate./Climate change is a major threat for intergenerational justice, as young people will experience stronger consequences of climate change in their future adult lives than older people are facing todayis. Their claim is to imple­ment the Paris agreement 2015, in which many countries set the goal to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees. School students are the largest group of FFF protesters (14–19 years). In countries of the Global South, the FFF groups’ visions of the future are supported by scientific, ancestral and territorial knowledge. They also project an imagined alternative future that is based on the dreams and values of the communities that they represent.  ","The FFF movement received a lot of media attention, public awareness and support, and promoted stronger societal debates on sustainability. The movement emphasizes the need for urgent political action in regard to climate policies. The shift from viewing young people only as consumers towards paying attention to their role as active citizens could have unlocked a range of collective powerful drivers of pro-environmental actions. People reported increased awareness and motivation; environmentally positive changes were most frequent in private sphere behaviours, particularly in the domains of mobility, consumption and waste, whereas few changes in public sphere behaviour were reported. /Their call for action sparked an international awakening, with students and activists uniting around the globe to protest outside their local parliaments and city halls. The goal of the movement is to put moral pressure on policymakers, to make them listen to the scientists, and then to take forceful action to limit global warming.

The end goal of subsidy removal is surely to reduce fishing mortality in overharvested fisheries.

Through the Household Asset Building Program (HABP), PSNP beneficiaries are provided with employment so that they can attain sustainable food security and ‘graduate’ from the programme. These complementary interventions include microcredit for agricultural inputs, and technical support for productive investments in irrigation, terracing, and livestock fattening. The PSNP is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and usually equals over half of the Ministry’s budget. Since its inception in 2005, with the objective of achieving sustainable food security for chronic and transitory food insecure households in rural Ethiopia, the PSNP has provided timely and predictable food and cash transfers to smooth consumption over the lean season, thereby preventing the distress sale of assets. A combination of food and cash is provided, often in return for labour on public works programmes. These are usually labour-intensive projects, such as road rehabilitation, soil conservation, and reforestation, which benefit the community in terms of improved soil fertility and land productivity, access to market infrastructure, drinking water and irrigation structures, education and health centres. The PSNP has been strongly supported by donors since its launch, and the government however is gradually increasing its contribution. It has demonstrated the benefits and long-term cost savings of a wide, predictable and sustained safety net scheme that enhances the population’s resilience to shocks, rather than relying on ad hoc humanitarian and emergency responses. In light of this success, social protection schemes in Ethiopia are being scaled up to include more beneficiaries with diverse needs. Since 2017, the PSNP started to include urban households among its beneficiaries. The programme’s budget also increased in 2015/16 in response to the worst drought in decades, which affected nearly 10 million Ethiopians. Ethiopia’s Safety Net program is the second largest in Africa (after South Africa) and is one of the largest safety net programs in the world.

Nile perch is by far the highest valued species in the lake’s fishery, supporting a multi- million dollar export industry that provides the three East African countries with about US $350 million in export earnings per year. Prior to the late 1990s, Lake Victoria fisheries management was conducted through centralized state-controlled fisheries authorities, with little or no provision for involving fisheries stakeholders in the fishery decision-making processIn Lake Victoria, agreement among the riparian governments (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania), development partners (European Union and World Bank) and the regional Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization (LVFO) led to the production of government guidelines for the establishment and operations of the locally organized Beach Management Units (BMUs). Co-management in Lake Victoria was instigated and implemented from the highest tiers of government, influenced by donors and external partners over international food safety concerns of exported Nile perch. This drove a process that relied on existing formal institutional structures as provided by the Fisheries Act and associated regulations. The process appeared to have largely ignored the realities of the informal institutions of fishing. Although adoption of the lake fisheries co-management program was viewed as a good option for regulating the exploitation of the fishery, catch and effort continue to expand on Lake Victoria, leading to concerns about the ability of the co-management program to manage this valuable fishery in a sustainable manner. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40152-020-00195-x#Sec3 ; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/lre.12095?saml_referrer",Africa,Kenya,Kenya,,,,,,,,,Promoter,Promoter,,,,Promoter,Promoter,,,Promoter,,,,Both public and private sectors,,2000-2010,Yes,no,Years,,Fisheries,,"Inland surface waters and water bodies/freshwater, Coastal areas intensively used for multiple purposes by humans",State,I don't know,I don't know,Slight positive effect,Large positive effect,Slight positive effect,Slight negative effect,I don't know,Slight positive effect,Slight negative effect,Slight negative effect,I don't know,Slight negative effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,Slight negative effect,I don't know,,Slight positive effect,Slight positive effect,Large  positive effect,Slight positive effect,Slight positive effect,Slight positive effect,Slight negative effect,Slight negative effect,Slight positive effect,I don't know,,Slight negative effect,I don't know,I don't know,Slight negative effect,I don't know,I don't know,Slight negative effect,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,Slight negative effect,Large positive effect,Slight positive effect,Slight positive effect,I don't know,I don't know,Slight negative effect,Slight negative effect,I don't know,," Before colonization, predating 1900, clan elders and local leaders (chiefs, sub-chiefs and village heads) controlled access to and use of fisheries by decree, determining when fishing could be done, where it was allowed and who could do it. The local leaders were very influential in fisheries management then. Following adoption of the co-management model in Lake Victoria, the local leaders seem to have lost this influence. From a review of co-management documents (BMU guidelines, regulations and the Fisheries Act), it was noted that local leaders have not been allocated any roles in co-management. Overall demand for fish during the pre-colonial period was limited by low density of the riparian population, and fishing gears comprising mainly inshore deployment of nets and baskets, although this could have localized impact on stocks. ","As currently constituted, the government still holds most decision-making powers that structure co-management, with fisheries management retaining the character of a traditional top–down approach. Fisher folk’s participation is largely a formalized action aimed at implementing externally crafted rules.  The creation of BMUs has not systematically ensured the success of co-management of Lake Victoria fisheries. BMUs are involved in activities that have high potential for social sustainability, but have been either unable or unwilling to undertake their core functions related to enforcement and compliance with fishing rules.","As currently constituted, the government still holds most decision-making powers that structure co-management, with fisheries management retaining the character of a traditional top–down approach. Fisher folk’s participation is largely a formalized action aimed at implementing externally crafted rules.  For the fisheries of Lake Victoria (Kenya), the introduction of co-management established Beach Management Units (BMUs) on a model of participatory decision-making. Unsurprisingly, given global experiences of institutions for resource users’ participation in co-management, the structures established across Lake Victoria (Kenya) have not resulted in effective participation of fisher folk. From the evidence, it can be concluded that institutions and the interactions between them are important for the social–ecological structure of that co-management. The formal and informal institutions interact in ways that are not complementary, undermining the ambitions of fisheries co-management. Informal rules shape fisheries practices at the beach level. For instance, corruption undermines enforcement of fisheries rules with outcomes that are socially and ecologically damaging https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40152-020-00195-x",Yes,"The BMU regulations were first presented to the Lake Victoria (Kenya) riparian fisheries officers and later to fisher folk representatives (BMU chairpersons and secretaries), local leaders, researchers and local and national NGOs at workshops organized by the government. Government organized training of extension staff, NGOs, faith-based organizations (FBOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) on co-management principles. The NGOs and FBOs have a history of working with fisher folk by providing training, credit and development of alternative income-generating activities.
From the findings, it was established that the historical administrative structures at the local level consisting of chiefs, sub-chiefs, and village heads played a key role in determining how fisher folk participated in the development of co-management local institutions. The local leaders were powerful and influential in fisheries management prior to co-management, and in most cases, they were obeyed without questioning. They determined who, when, where, and how fishing was done. The local administrative structures provided a link between the government and fisher folk during co-management development. However, during co-management implementation, the local administration seems to have lost fisheries management power. Instead, implementation of fisheries rules within co-management at the beach level is undertaken by the BMUs, while local leaders handle social disputes within their locations. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40152-020-00195-x#Sec3",,"Promoting adaptive governance and management, Promoting sustainable governance and management of seascapes, oceans and marine systems, Improving freshwater management, protection and connectivity, Improving the sustainability of economic and financial systems",Yes,"The changes in fisheries governance in Lake Victoria has been a major undertaking.

The BMUs were designed to enable participation of fisher folk in management decisions through local democratic structures. The former fisheries institution mandated through the Fisheries Act of 1989 was managed by local fisheries officers, with powers of enforcement for breaches of fishery regulations. This has been replaced by the Fisheries Management and Development Act, 2016 that devolves fisheries compliance and enforcement to the BMUs. It is clear that the creation of the BMUs was a process driven by the riparian governments in consultation with, and possibly driven by, powerful external actors, also representing economic and consumer interests beyond the region.

There was no evidence that the management rules included any degree of co-design with users of the resource, but a firm depiction of government as the higher authority and adjudicator of what was included in fisheries management rules. This influences the way the rules are viewed by fisher folk, although they are required to comply with fisheries regulations of the Fisheries Act. Nonetheless, fisher folk seemed to have a larger influence on whether fisheries rules would be implemented or not, and outcome of co-management. From observations at the four beaches studied, it was evident that although the government expected fisher folk to implement fisheries rules, observed practice in all four BMUs were contravening government fisheries rules, most clearly seen through the increased use of illegal fishing gears and methods.","Values, Changes in primary sector",,"Financial insecurity, Unsustainable production and consumption patterns",,No,This is an example with transformative potential with unintended consequences for food security and fisheries in Kenya,I remain neutral,,,

The process begins with extensive action-based research in which co-participants and key partners work to identify matters of concern and a pressing central question. Complex problems in unequal societies require careful yet rigorous explorations of different ways of knowing, being and doing. When popular and political debates are polarised and filled with judgements, entangled livelihoods and marginalised voices are often ignored. It’s why we believe that creative and empathetic methods can facilitate multiple forms of listening to and sharing knowledge across diverse publics. Empatheatre is one such method. Emerging from the South African context, Empatheatre has, over the past five years, developed innovative new ways of constructing social spaces for equitable public dialogue.

1) of our food system to enable equitable access to nutrition for all whilst securing sustainable livelihoods for producers and restoring nature. We will work to enable a socially just and ecologically safe transition to a system in which food is produced and consumed in a way that is safe, affordable, nutritious and sustainable for all. A future-fit food system will optimise for people and the planet, balancing health and nutritional outcomes with restoration of the ecosystems and farming livelihoods on which we all depend. This will be underpinned by both climate mitigation and adaptation practices, with a focus on mainstreaming regenerative agriculture, enhancing resilience and transforming the supply chains that deliver key commodities from plant to plate, crop to cup.
2) to renewable energy that is ecologically safe, socially just and resets the goals of the energy production system. We will work to shift to a system that: is radically decarbonised and resilient in a rapidly changing world; depends wholly on renewables and/or other carbon-neutral sources; actively engages those who produce, trade and consume energy in the sector’s development; prioritises universal energy access by providing affordable, reliable, ecologically safe and human-rights respecting energy.
3) in the role of business to drive a just and regenerative economy. We will work with business leaders and other change actors in the market system to shift how and why business operates. We are looking to reset business as a driver of a just and regenerative economy in which people and the planet take priority.","Values, Changes in primary sector, States",,"Views of biodiversity as separate from humans and as such, to be controlled, managed and exploited, Unsustainable production and consumption patterns",,No,"This is a global example with transformative potential related to the business sector

These paired observations covered 181 smallholder communities from the south to the north of Nicaragua. The motivation behind these observations was to aid in the agricultural recovery after Hurricane Mitch and to assess if Movimiento Campesino a Campesino farms were progressing towards higher levels of sustainability. Participants believed it was crucial to rebuild agriculture in a participatory and sustainable manner and that the study could help define and identify local capacities.","At the time of the study, there was a pressing need for researchers and farmers to identify practices that were moving away from sustainability and validate those that were moving towards more sustainable systems. However, due to economic constraints, few participatory approaches attempted to assess the real impact of alternative practices. Developing reliable indicators of sustainability for interested farmers has been a key concern in monitoring the impact of sustainable land management systems. In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch, one of the five strongest hurricanes of the 20th century in the Caribbean, hit Central America, causing at least US$ 6.7 billion in damage to infrastructure and industry. This extreme ecological disruption provided Movimiento Campesino a Campesino with the opportunity to evaluate a decade of practices. The study revealed that biodiverse agroecological farms, including agroforestry, contour farming, and cover cropping, retained 20–40 percent more topsoil, suffered less erosion, and experienced lower economic losses than neighboring farms practicing conventional monocultures, allowing them to recover faster.

","The aim of the Observatory is to provide a global resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, the private sector and civil society to find solutions to the most pressing challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence. The Observatory showcases information about the readiness of countries to adopt AI ethically and responsibly. It also hosts the AI Ethics and Governance Lab, which gathers contributions, impactful research, toolkits and good practices across a range of issues related to AI ethics, governance, responsible innovation, standards, institutional capacities, generative AI, and neurotechnologies. With its unique mandate, UNESCO has led the international effort to ensure that science and technology develop with strong ethical guardrails for decades. UNESCO’s work on AI ethics and governance stems from the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted by 193 countries in 2021. 

Be it on genetic research, climate change, or scientific research, UNESCO has delivered global standards to maximize the benefits of the scientific discoveries, while minimizing the downside risks, ensuring they contribute to a more inclusive, sustainable, and peaceful world. It has also identified frontier challenges in areas such as the ethics of neurotechnology, on climate engineering, and the internet of things.

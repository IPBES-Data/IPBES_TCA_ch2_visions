# TCA MAPS and figures

This repository is part of an ongoing IPBES project.

The authors do not take any responsibility for it's copntent or the correct working of the code. If scripts in here wipe your data, you are on your own.

Nevertheless, please feel free to browse the code and re-use it at your own risk. 

Once finalized, the final repo will be published on Zenodo 


## Metadata

- **Assessment**: TCA
- **Chapter**: 2 and SPM
- **Short Name**: visions and case studies

- **Requested by**: Sebastian Villasante and Lucas Garibaldi


- **Context**: 3 databases of visions and case studies are available: 
1- Cases from TCA corpus (corpus_cases)
2- Visions database (~1000 visions have been identified by the TCA team, visions)
3- Case studies database (~400 case studies have been identified, cases)

Based on the Location (where the vision/case studies were designed) and the geographical scope of those visions/cases (regions where the vision will act), the DATA TSU: 
A- mapped the case studies within IPBES subregions, 
B- analyzed the growth of cases of TCA corpus with mayor global changes (land use, fisheries, etc)

## Folders

- **`data`**: data files created during the running of the code file and contains cached as well as final data files.
- **`outputs`**: figures, tables, docs created during the running of the code` file in low-res as well as high-res.
- **`src`**: R scripts used to run the code in the repo. Files in this folder will be sourced initially.
